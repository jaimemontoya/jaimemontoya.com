Saudi Aramco having a negative 2025. Finally a positive day for Tesla. Tesla richer than TSMC and Broadcom. Buffett continues enjoying an outstanding 2025. Arnault experienced modest growth but not as good as his peers.</a></h2><div class=\"floatleft\"><img src=\"/opinion/2025/03/01/07/27/img/20250301-0727-collage.jpg\" alt=\"20250301-0727-collage\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" class=\"floatleft\"><p>Dip-buyers allowed Nvidia to close the week on Friday with a positive result of almost 4% for its stock price.</p><p>The stock price for Saudi Aramco has experienced a negative growth of -3.39% in 2025. The company is still the 6th richest in the world, but with the U.S. technology sector in a bullish environment, which has not been the case in 2025, it might be difficult for Saudi Aramco to stay in such a high position in the rankings.</p><p>Finally, Tesla had a positive day in the stock market on Friday. But that was not enough to make the February 2025 numbers become positive for the company. February was a catastrophic month for Tesla, where it started the month with a stock price of $383.68 on 3 Feb 2025, and on 28 Feb 2025 the price was $293.04. With the Friday positive results, Tesla moved from 11th to 9th richest company in the world. TSMC moved from 9th to 10th, while Broadcom was downgraded from 10th to 11th.</p><p>The extraordinary 2025 for Warren Buffett is at full speed. A growth of 13.91% in two months, January and February 2025, represents excellent results for the company. On Friday, Buffett’s net worth increased by $4.5 billion.</p><p>Bernard Arnault had a comparatively modest growth of $500 million on Friday, which was not as great as the growth for other top billionaire people in his league. The U.S. billionaires in the top 10 of the ranking probably all benefited from the positive day that the U.S. experienced in the stock market on Friday. Nonetheless, February 2025 had an overall negative balance for the U.S. stock market.</p></div><div class=\"clearboth\">Published: 7:27 PM GMT · 1 Mar 2025</div><a href=\"https://jaimemontoya.com/opinion/\">Richest companies and people since 2024-Dec-21, including Jaime Montoya's stock market, business & finance opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT</a></p><div id=\"richest-company\"></div><div id=\"richest-people\"></div><div id=\"jaime-montoya-capital\"></div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ol><li><a href=\"about/\">About</a>: My one-page resume.<li><a href=\"blog/\">Blog</a>: Software technical documentation blog for myself and the world.<li><a href=\"book/\">Book reviews</a>: My reviews for some of the books I have read from cover to cover.<li><a href=\"capital/\">Capital</a>: Capital history in my records since May 5, 2024.<li><a href=\"coursera/\">Coursera</a>: Coursera courses I have successfully completed.<li><a href=\"finances/\">Finances</a>: Personal finance software I have created.<li><a href=\"investment\">Investment</a>: Mutual fund and stock investments I have made since April 12, 2024.<li><a href=\"market/\">Market</a>: Monitoring tool to beat the market.<li><a href=\"news/\">News</a>: Personal news since November 7, 2024, 00:00 AM GMT.<li><a href=\"opinion/\">Opinion</a>: Stock Market, Business & Finance Opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT.<li><a href=\"portfolio/\">Portfolio</a>: Websites I have created, designed, developed, upgraded, maintained and/or hosted.<li><a href=\"reading/\">Reading</a>: Listing all of the books I have read from cover to cover since August 31, 2018.<li><a href=\"run/\">Running</a>: Running history I have endured since August 2, 2020.<li><a href=\"teaching/\">Teaching</a>: In-person classes I have taught.<li><a href=\"weight/\">Weight</a>: Weight history from my body since October 19, 2019.</ol></p>";
