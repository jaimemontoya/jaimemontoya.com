Berkshire Hathaway navigating well the 2025 uncertainty and Buffett increasing his massive wealth. Tesla richer than Broadcom. Ellison lost $12.1 billion.</a></h2><div class=\"floatleft\"><img src=\"/opinion/2025/03/07/04/33/img/20250307-0433-collage.jpg\" alt=\"20250307-0433-collage\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" class=\"floatleft\"><p>The new U.S. tariffs are creating an environment of uncertainty that is probably affecting AI stocks. As a result, Nvidia is one of the most affected companies in the stock market. The company had started the year with a price of $138.31 on 2 Jan 2025. The price on 6 Mar 2025 was $110.57, the lowest in 2025.</p><p>Berkshire Hathaway has been able to navigate the U.S. and global markets uncertainty well in 2025. The company, unlike AI companies and the technology sector, is having excellent 2025 results. Warren Buffett is increasing his net worth consistently and Berkshire Hathaway is one of the 8 companies in the world with a market capitalization that surpasses $1 trillion.</p><p>Tesla is richer than Broadcom, with Tesla being upgraded from 11th to 10th, and Broadcom downgraded from 10th to 11th, in the ranking of richest companies in the world. But the reason why Tesla surpassed Broadcom was not because Tesla had a good day on Thursday. In fact, Tesla suffered a 5.61% stock price decline that day. But Broadcom suffered an even worse day, with a decline of 6.33%, for many of the same reasons that affected Nvidia too on Thursday (U.S. tariffs uncertainty affecting AI stocks and the technology sector). One of the many 2025 freefall problems for Tesla for now is the \"China problem\". Tesla seems to be losing market share in Europe. BYD is on a growth trajectory in 2025, while Tesla is in the opposite direction. As direct competitors, Tesla is being affected by the presence of BYD in the industry, as a big player in the competition against Tesla. The competition has forced Tesla to reduce prices while the demand has not increased for Tesla vehicles. That translates into lower profitability. Tesla is an automaker as its core business, not a technology company. That means that it is not immune to the supply and demand rules. If the sales of cars are creating pressure for Tesla in the supply and demand dynamics, that will affect their financial position, even if the company has great technology projects or initiatives. It is still an automaker that needs to sell more cars to maintain its dominant position in the market. The political involvement of Elon Musk in the U.S. government does not seem to be helping Tesla in 2025. At least not for now.</p><p>Larry Ellison lost $12.1 billion (6.06% of his fortune) on Thursday in the stock market fluctuations as Oracle suffered another bad day in 2025. The AI and technology sector, in general, are having a negative 2025.</p></div><div class=\"clearboth\">Published: 4:33 AM GMT · 6 Mar 2025</div><a href=\"https://jaimemontoya.com/opinion/\">Richest companies and people since 2024-Dec-21, including Jaime Montoya's stock market, business & finance opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT</a></p><div id=\"richest-company\"></div><div id=\"richest-people\"></div><div id=\"jaime-montoya-capital\"></div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ol><li><a href=\"about/\">About</a>: My one-page resume.<li><a href=\"blog/\">Blog</a>: Software technical documentation blog for myself and the world.<li><a href=\"book/\">Book reviews</a>: My reviews for some of the books I have read from cover to cover.<li><a href=\"capital/\">Capital</a>: Capital history in my records since May 5, 2024.<li><a href=\"coursera/\">Coursera</a>: Coursera courses I have successfully completed.<li><a href=\"finances/\">Finances</a>: Personal finance software I have created.<li><a href=\"investment\">Investment</a>: Mutual fund and stock investments I have made since April 12, 2024.<li><a href=\"market/\">Market</a>: Monitoring tool to beat the market.<li><a href=\"news/\">News</a>: Personal news since November 7, 2024, 00:00 AM GMT.<li><a href=\"opinion/\">Opinion</a>: Stock Market, Business & Finance Opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT.<li><a href=\"portfolio/\">Portfolio</a>: Websites I have created, designed, developed, upgraded, maintained and/or hosted.<li><a href=\"reading/\">Reading</a>: Listing all of the books I have read from cover to cover since August 31, 2018.<li><a href=\"run/\">Running</a>: Running history I have endured since August 2, 2020.<li><a href=\"teaching/\">Teaching</a>: In-person classes I have taught.<li><a href=\"weight/\">Weight</a>: Weight history from my body since October 19, 2019.</ol></p>";
