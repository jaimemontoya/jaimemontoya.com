Berkshire Hathaway navigating the crisis with intelligence. Musk in an alarming freefall. Ellison potentially making his company to replace Tesla as the Magnificent Seven Stocks elite group.</a></h2><div class=\"floatleft\"><img src=\"/opinion/2025/03/18/00/31/img/20250318-0031-collage.jpg\" alt=\"20250318-0031-collage\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" class=\"floatleft\"><p>Last week was positive for Nvidia’s share price but this week has started with weak results for the company. The year to date performance for Nvidia is -13.58%. The situation does not seem promising as there is uncertainty in the political spectrum. The technology sector is having a difficult 2025 and Nvidia is suffering the impact as one of the leaders in that sector.</p><p>Berkshire Hathaway is having an impressive 15.94% growth in 2025 for its share price. The company is navigating the economic downturn intelligently and growing consistently when the U.S. markets are suffering a decline and a situation of political uncertainty that is making investors cautious.</p><p>The situation for Elon Musk has been unimaginably negative in 2025 for the growth of his wealth. The share price of Tesla has suffered a massive decline of 37.25%, just in 2025. Musk’s net worth is now at $328.5 billion, which is an alarmingly low value compared to the over $400 billion that he had just a few months ago. His involvement in politics and closeness to President Donald Trump seems to be having serious financial consequences. It remains to be seen how investors react in the upcoming months as the U.S. political situation is evolving at a rapid pace and changing in real-time.</p><p>Larry Ellison’s net worth has been in a positive trajectory of growth since 12 Mar 2025. Nonetheless, the technology sector has been suffering a difficult 2025. Ellison has been close to President Donald Trump a few times in recent weeks, but his company is not a target of protests the way Tesla is. Also, Larry Ellison has not had political involvement the way Elon Musk has. For now, Ellison is in good shape to continue the race making his company, Oracle, grow in the ranking of richest companies. With Tesla in steady decline, maybe Oracle could run faster to become, one day,  part of the Magnificent Seven Stocks. At this pace it is not unreasonable to think that Oracle may replace Tesla in the elite group of top 7 high tech companies.</p></div><div class=\"clearboth\">Published: 12:31 AM GMT · 18 Mar 2025</div><a href=\"https://jaimemontoya.com/opinion/\">Richest companies and people since 2024-Dec-21, including Jaime Montoya's stock market, business & finance opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT</a></p><div id=\"richest-company\"></div><div id=\"richest-people\"></div><div id=\"jaime-montoya-capital\"></div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ol><li><a href=\"about/\">About</a>: My one-page resume.<li><a href=\"blog/\">Blog</a>: Software technical documentation blog for myself and the world.<li><a href=\"book/\">Book reviews</a>: My reviews for some of the books I have read from cover to cover.<li><a href=\"capital/\">Capital</a>: Capital history in my records since May 5, 2024.<li><a href=\"coursera/\">Coursera</a>: Coursera courses I have successfully completed.<li><a href=\"finances/\">Finances</a>: Personal finance software I have created.<li><a href=\"investment\">Investment</a>: Mutual fund and stock investments I have made since April 12, 2024.<li><a href=\"market/\">Market</a>: Monitoring tool to beat the market.<li><a href=\"news/\">News</a>: Personal news since November 7, 2024, 00:00 AM GMT.<li><a href=\"opinion/\">Opinion</a>: Stock Market, Business & Finance Opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT.<li><a href=\"portfolio/\">Portfolio</a>: Websites I have created, designed, developed, upgraded, maintained and/or hosted.<li><a href=\"reading/\">Reading</a>: Listing all of the books I have read from cover to cover since August 31, 2018.<li><a href=\"run/\">Running</a>: Running history I have endured since August 2, 2020.<li><a href=\"teaching/\">Teaching</a>: In-person classes I have taught.<li><a href=\"weight/\">Weight</a>: Weight history from my body since October 19, 2019.</ol></p>";
