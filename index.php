Outstanding 2025 for Berkshire Hathaway. Microsoft richer than Nvidia. Ellison losing large sums of money. Buffett richer than Arnault. Buffett navigating the crisis in the economy, with success.</a></h2><div class=\"floatleft\"><img src=\"/opinion/2025/03/27/11/41/img/20250327-1141-collage.jpg\" alt=\"20250327-1141-collage\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" class=\"floatleft\"><p>The share price growth experienced by Nvidia last week was going to have an expected challenge: sustainability. Nvidia is suffering from poor performance this week. The numbers do not lie. Nvidia’s year to date performance is -17.75%. Microsoft is richer than Nvidia again. This is not a surprise. Nvidia is highly volatile. Microsoft was upgraded from 3rd to 2nd richest company in the world, while Nvidia was downgraded from 2nd to 3rd. Microsoft had a bad Wednesday, but not as bad as the day was for Nvidia.</p><p>Berkshire Hathaway is having a fascinating 2025. While the anxiety grows and the economy is threatened by uncertainty, Berkshire Hathaway keeps growing steadily. As a result, Warren Buffett is richer than Bernard Arnault, with Buffett advancing from 6th to 5th richest person on the planet. Arnault saw his position fall from 5th to 6th.</p><p>Larry Ellison’s net worth lost $7.3 billion on Wednesday. Oracle has a year to date performance of -10.98%. The situation for Oracle is similar to that of Magnificent 7 Stocks, where the technology sector is suffering a difficult 2025, which coincides approximately to the same period of time since President Donald Trump has been in power for his second term as President of the United States. Investors do not seem to have confidence in the current direction of the economy in the U.S.</p><p>Bernard Arnault’s company is not in the technology sector. Nonetheless, it is experiencing a similarly difficult 2025, with a year to date performance of -7.59%. The decline started on 28 Jan 2025 and it has not stopped yet. Bad news for Arnault, the richest person in Europe, who is seeing his fortune in steady decline.</p></div><div class=\"clearboth\">Published: 11:41 AM GMT · 27 Mar 2025</div><a href=\"https://jaimemontoya.com/opinion/\">Richest companies and people since 2024-Dec-21, including Jaime Montoya's stock market, business & finance opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT</a></p><div id=\"richest-company\"></div><div id=\"richest-people\"></div><div id=\"jaime-montoya-capital\"></div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ol><li><a href=\"about/\">About</a>: My one-page resume.<li><a href=\"blog/\">Blog</a>: Software technical documentation blog for myself and the world.<li><a href=\"book/\">Book reviews</a>: My reviews for some of the books I have read from cover to cover.<li><a href=\"capital/\">Capital</a>: Capital history in my records since May 5, 2024.<li><a href=\"coursera/\">Coursera</a>: Coursera courses I have successfully completed.<li><a href=\"finances/\">Finances</a>: Personal finance software I have created.<li><a href=\"investment\">Investment</a>: Mutual fund and stock investments I have made since April 12, 2024.<li><a href=\"market/\">Market</a>: Monitoring tool to beat the market.<li><a href=\"news/\">News</a>: Personal news since November 7, 2024, 00:00 AM GMT.<li><a href=\"opinion/\">Opinion</a>: Stock Market, Business & Finance Opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT.<li><a href=\"portfolio/\">Portfolio</a>: Websites I have created, designed, developed, upgraded, maintained and/or hosted.<li><a href=\"reading/\">Reading</a>: Listing all of the books I have read from cover to cover since August 31, 2018.<li><a href=\"run/\">Running</a>: Running history I have endured since August 2, 2020.<li><a href=\"teaching/\">Teaching</a>: In-person classes I have taught.<li><a href=\"weight/\">Weight</a>: Weight history from my body since October 19, 2019.</ol></p>";
