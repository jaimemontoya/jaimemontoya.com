Berkshire Hathaway demonstrating impressive resilience. Microsoft richer than Nvidia. TSMC richer than Broadcom. Zuckerberg lost $7.7 billion. Ortega winning while most top American billionaires were losing.</a></h2><div class=\"floatleft\"><img src=\"/opinion/2025/03/19/04/05/img/20250319-0405-collage.jpg\" alt=\"20250319-0405-collage\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" class=\"floatleft\"><p>What Meta won for its share price from the beginning of 2025 to 14 Feb 2025, the company has lost it from 18 Feb 2025 to 18 Mar 2025. A full month of decline has resulted in Meta having an overall balance of -2.82%, as its year to date result. In other words, 2025 is in the negative field for Meta. In the artificial intelligence revolution, Meta has been banking on its investments to produce fruits by making the company a leader in this revolution. However, the competition is fierce, with other high tech companies also investing incredibly large amounts of money to win the artificial intelligence race. The economic uncertainty is not helping Meta and overall the technology sector is having a poor performance in 2025. As a result, Mark Zuckerberg keeps losing money with his net worth being reduced almost to less than $200 billion.</p><p>Berkshire Hathaway continues demonstrating impressive resilience in times of economic uncertainty and crisis. The market share for the company keeps increasing and consistently reporting growth, when the major U.S. markets are suffering significant losses.</p><p>Microsoft is richer than Nvidia. Microsoft was upgraded from 3rd to 2nd richest company on the planet, while Nvidia was downgraded from 2nd to 3rd. Nvidia is much more volatile than Microsoft, so the ranking positions may change any time. Nvidia had three weeks of decline in a row. Last week was its week of growth. This week is on the trajectory of another week of decline. The balance is negative. Even if last week was positive for Nvidia, the lack of consistency makes it difficult for the company to have final positive results. This is evidenced by the fact that in 2025, the year to date share price performance for Nvidia has suffered a decline of 16.54%.</p><p>TSMC is again richer than Broadcom. Both companies have experienced high volatility and the race between both companies has been fierce. TMCS was upgraded from 10th to 9th, while Broadcom was downgraded from 9th to 10th, in the ranking of richest companies in the world.</p><p>Amancio Ortega probably benefited from not being in the U.S., as the headquarters of his company. From 14 Mar 2025 Inditex has been growing, not at the rate that it had been falling for its share price, but at least it is on a trajectory of growth now. Ortega, unlike most top 10 billionaires, had a day of growth for his net worth.</p></div><div class=\"clearboth\">Published: 4:05 AM GMT · 19 Mar 2025</div><a href=\"https://jaimemontoya.com/opinion/\">Richest companies and people since 2024-Dec-21, including Jaime Montoya's stock market, business & finance opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT</a></p><div id=\"richest-company\"></div><div id=\"richest-people\"></div><div id=\"jaime-montoya-capital\"></div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ol><li><a href=\"about/\">About</a>: My one-page resume.<li><a href=\"blog/\">Blog</a>: Software technical documentation blog for myself and the world.<li><a href=\"book/\">Book reviews</a>: My reviews for some of the books I have read from cover to cover.<li><a href=\"capital/\">Capital</a>: Capital history in my records since May 5, 2024.<li><a href=\"coursera/\">Coursera</a>: Coursera courses I have successfully completed.<li><a href=\"finances/\">Finances</a>: Personal finance software I have created.<li><a href=\"investment\">Investment</a>: Mutual fund and stock investments I have made since April 12, 2024.<li><a href=\"market/\">Market</a>: Monitoring tool to beat the market.<li><a href=\"news/\">News</a>: Personal news since November 7, 2024, 00:00 AM GMT.<li><a href=\"opinion/\">Opinion</a>: Stock Market, Business & Finance Opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT.<li><a href=\"portfolio/\">Portfolio</a>: Websites I have created, designed, developed, upgraded, maintained and/or hosted.<li><a href=\"reading/\">Reading</a>: Listing all of the books I have read from cover to cover since August 31, 2018.<li><a href=\"run/\">Running</a>: Running history I have endured since August 2, 2020.<li><a href=\"teaching/\">Teaching</a>: In-person classes I have taught.<li><a href=\"weight/\">Weight</a>: Weight history from my body since October 19, 2019.</ol></p>";
