Nvidia stocks tumbled. Microsoft richer than Nvidia. Arnault benefited from not having his company’s headquarters and stocks mainly in the U.S. Jeff Bezos lost $6.6 billion. </a></h2><div class=\"floatleft\"><img src=\"/opinion/2025/03/04/03/50/img/20250304-0350-collage.jpg\" alt=\"20250304-0350-collage\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" class=\"floatleft\"><p>Saudi Aramco benefited from being outside of the U.S. to make its stock price grow on Monday, since for the U.S., the stock market had a catastrophic day of losses. Apparently those losses were the result of fears about the tariffs taking effect on 4 Mar 2025.</p><p>Nvidia stocks tumbled on Monday resulting from concerns regarding tariffs that could affect the company’s chip export sales. If AI spending is not sustainable for 2025, Nvidia would be likely to experience heavy financial losses. As a result of the terrible performance for Nvidia on Monday, Microsoft is now richer than Nvidia. It is not that Microsoft had a good Monday for its stock (2.14% decrease), but certainly Nvidia had a much worse day for its stock price (8.69% decrease).</p><p>Bernard Arnault also benefited from not being in the U.S. for the headquarters of his company. His net worth decreased by $1 billion on Monday, but that is a smaller amount than what the other billionaires in his league of top 10 richest people in the world lost. For example, Jeff Bezos lost $6.6 billion on Monday. The week started with results that were a horrible nightmare for the U.S. stock market.</p></div><div class=\"clearboth\">Published: 3:50 PM GMT · 4 Mar 2025</div><a href=\"https://jaimemontoya.com/opinion/\">Richest companies and people since 2024-Dec-21, including Jaime Montoya's stock market, business & finance opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT</a></p><div id=\"richest-company\"></div><div id=\"richest-people\"></div><div id=\"jaime-montoya-capital\"></div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ol><li><a href=\"about/\">About</a>: My one-page resume.<li><a href=\"blog/\">Blog</a>: Software technical documentation blog for myself and the world.<li><a href=\"book/\">Book reviews</a>: My reviews for some of the books I have read from cover to cover.<li><a href=\"capital/\">Capital</a>: Capital history in my records since May 5, 2024.<li><a href=\"coursera/\">Coursera</a>: Coursera courses I have successfully completed.<li><a href=\"finances/\">Finances</a>: Personal finance software I have created.<li><a href=\"investment\">Investment</a>: Mutual fund and stock investments I have made since April 12, 2024.<li><a href=\"market/\">Market</a>: Monitoring tool to beat the market.<li><a href=\"news/\">News</a>: Personal news since November 7, 2024, 00:00 AM GMT.<li><a href=\"opinion/\">Opinion</a>: Stock Market, Business & Finance Opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT.<li><a href=\"portfolio/\">Portfolio</a>: Websites I have created, designed, developed, upgraded, maintained and/or hosted.<li><a href=\"reading/\">Reading</a>: Listing all of the books I have read from cover to cover since August 31, 2018.<li><a href=\"run/\">Running</a>: Running history I have endured since August 2, 2020.<li><a href=\"teaching/\">Teaching</a>: In-person classes I have taught.<li><a href=\"weight/\">Weight</a>: Weight history from my body since October 19, 2019.</ol></p>";
