Berkshire Hathaway and Buffett navigating successfully the crisis. Nvidia highly volatile and winning on Thursday. Nvidia richer than Microsoft. Broadcom richer than TSMC.</a></h2><div class=\"floatleft\"><img src=\"/opinion/2025/03/14/06/18/img/20250314-0618-collage.jpg\" alt=\"20250314-0618-collage\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" class=\"floatleft\"><p>The bearish sentiment is affecting Meta, which has been in a freefall trajectory since 18 Feb 2025. The trade-war fears seem to be making investors sell out Meta stocks. Mark Zuckerberg lost approximately $10 billion on Thursday.</p><p>It is impressive how Berkshire Hathaway is navigating the economic difficulties of 2025 in the U.S. stock market. From the list of the 10 richest companies, it is the only one with a positive balance in the last 30 days. As a result, Warren Buffett increased his net worth by $2.3 billion on Thursday.</p><p>Nvidia is a company with high volatility and that is how Thursday was a great day for the company in the stock market. Nonetheless, the economic uncertainties make it difficult to predict the success or failure of the company in 2025, in terms of stock growth. At least, it is becoming evident that 2025 may not have the exponential growth of the last couple of years for Nvidia. For now, the high volatility has helped Nvidia to become the second richest company in the world from its previous third position, while Microsoft was downgraded from second to third. This happened on Thursday.</p><p>The race between Broadcom and TSMC continues, with Broadcom upgraded from 10th to 9th, and TSMC downgraded from 9th to 10th, in the ranking of richest companies in the world.</p></div><div class=\"clearboth\">Published: 6:18 AM GMT · 14 Mar 2025</div><a href=\"https://jaimemontoya.com/opinion/\">Richest companies and people since 2024-Dec-21, including Jaime Montoya's stock market, business & finance opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT</a></p><div id=\"richest-company\"></div><div id=\"richest-people\"></div><div id=\"jaime-montoya-capital\"></div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ol><li><a href=\"about/\">About</a>: My one-page resume.<li><a href=\"blog/\">Blog</a>: Software technical documentation blog for myself and the world.<li><a href=\"book/\">Book reviews</a>: My reviews for some of the books I have read from cover to cover.<li><a href=\"capital/\">Capital</a>: Capital history in my records since May 5, 2024.<li><a href=\"coursera/\">Coursera</a>: Coursera courses I have successfully completed.<li><a href=\"finances/\">Finances</a>: Personal finance software I have created.<li><a href=\"investment\">Investment</a>: Mutual fund and stock investments I have made since April 12, 2024.<li><a href=\"market/\">Market</a>: Monitoring tool to beat the market.<li><a href=\"news/\">News</a>: Personal news since November 7, 2024, 00:00 AM GMT.<li><a href=\"opinion/\">Opinion</a>: Stock Market, Business & Finance Opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT.<li><a href=\"portfolio/\">Portfolio</a>: Websites I have created, designed, developed, upgraded, maintained and/or hosted.<li><a href=\"reading/\">Reading</a>: Listing all of the books I have read from cover to cover since August 31, 2018.<li><a href=\"run/\">Running</a>: Running history I have endured since August 2, 2020.<li><a href=\"teaching/\">Teaching</a>: In-person classes I have taught.<li><a href=\"weight/\">Weight</a>: Weight history from my body since October 19, 2019.</ol></p>";
