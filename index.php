Nvidia growing only after falling at a faster speed than its growth. TSMC richer than Broadcom. Ellison increased his net worth by $7.9 billion. Ortega’s net worth in decline. Ballmer richer than Ortega.</a></h2><div class=\"floatleft\"><img src=\"/opinion/2025/03/13/13/56/img/20250313-1356-collage.jpg\" alt=\"20250313-1356-collage\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" class=\"floatleft\"><p>The freefall for Apple shares that started on 10 Mar 2025, continues at a rapid pace. The year to date performance for Apple is -11.72%. The year of 2025 has been difficult for the U.S. stock market overall, and Apple has not been a safe haven for investors.</p><p>Nvidia has been in a trajectory of growth for its share price since 11 Mar 2025. Nonetheless, the company experienced heavy declines from 21 Feb 2025 to 10 Mar 2025. One theory about the behavior of growth in the last couple of days for Nvidia’s stock price, is that sell-offs are seen by investors as buying opportunities, following the commonplace investment advice of buy low, sell high.</p><p>TSMC is now richer than Broadcom, with TSMC being upgraded from 10th to 9th place, and Broadcom the opposite, in the ranking of richest companies in the world. The price volatility continues for both companies.</p><p>Larry Ellison experienced a good Wednesday for his net worth with an increase of 4.44% relative to the previous day, which represents $7.9 billion. Oracle experienced a positive Wednesday for its share price, but overall, 2025 has been a negative year for the company with heavy losses of more than 10% in the price from the beginning of the year to now.</p><p>Amancio Ortega has been losing large sums of money as his company, Inditex, has been in stock price decline in a consistent way since 19 Feb 2025. The decline has been much more abrupt, and still consistent, since 11 Mar 2025. As a result, the company is in negative share price balance overall in 2025, with a decrease of approximately 10%. Ortega was downgraded from 9th to 10th richest person in the world, with Steve Ballmer moving from the 10th to the 9th position.</p></div><div class=\"clearboth\">Published: 1:56 PM GMT · 13 Mar 2025</div><a href=\"https://jaimemontoya.com/opinion/\">Richest companies and people since 2024-Dec-21, including Jaime Montoya's stock market, business & finance opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT</a></p><div id=\"richest-company\"></div><div id=\"richest-people\"></div><div id=\"jaime-montoya-capital\"></div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ol><li><a href=\"about/\">About</a>: My one-page resume.<li><a href=\"blog/\">Blog</a>: Software technical documentation blog for myself and the world.<li><a href=\"book/\">Book reviews</a>: My reviews for some of the books I have read from cover to cover.<li><a href=\"capital/\">Capital</a>: Capital history in my records since May 5, 2024.<li><a href=\"coursera/\">Coursera</a>: Coursera courses I have successfully completed.<li><a href=\"finances/\">Finances</a>: Personal finance software I have created.<li><a href=\"investment\">Investment</a>: Mutual fund and stock investments I have made since April 12, 2024.<li><a href=\"market/\">Market</a>: Monitoring tool to beat the market.<li><a href=\"news/\">News</a>: Personal news since November 7, 2024, 00:00 AM GMT.<li><a href=\"opinion/\">Opinion</a>: Stock Market, Business & Finance Opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT.<li><a href=\"portfolio/\">Portfolio</a>: Websites I have created, designed, developed, upgraded, maintained and/or hosted.<li><a href=\"reading/\">Reading</a>: Listing all of the books I have read from cover to cover since August 31, 2018.<li><a href=\"run/\">Running</a>: Running history I have endured since August 2, 2020.<li><a href=\"teaching/\">Teaching</a>: In-person classes I have taught.<li><a href=\"weight/\">Weight</a>: Weight history from my body since October 19, 2019.</ol></p>";
