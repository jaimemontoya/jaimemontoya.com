Saudi Aramco in consistent decline. Zuckerber’s fortune is not in decline anymore. Arnault losing money in freefall mode.</a></h2><div class=\"floatleft\"><img src=\"/opinion/2025/03/15/10/43/img/20250315-1043-collage.jpg\" alt=\"20250315-1043-collage\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" class=\"floatleft\"><p>The stock market rebounded on Friday. The AI demand is helping Nvidia to maintain its position as the second richest company in the world, only behind Apple.</p><p>Saudi Aramco has a year to date decline of 7.49% for its share price. When evaluating the last 365 days, the decline is even worse: 16.69%. The company has accumulated so much money ($1.675 trillion in market capitalization) that even having a poor performance, it remains as the 6th richest in the world. In a healthier U.S. economy, that position could be difficult to keep.</p><p>From Monday to Friday, Meta was able to stabilize its situation and stop the consistent stock price fall. The week reached a flat trajectory, approximately, as compared to the freefall pattern that it had been experiencing during recent weeks. This is a relief for Mark Zuckerberg, who is still in a race as a solid contender to one day become the richest person on earth.</p><p>March 2025 has been difficult for LVMH. The company is in a freefall trajectory with its share price in consistent decline. Bernard Arnault, currently 76 years old, wants to keep running the company until he is 85. It remains to be seen how potential trade wars and political uncertainty will affect LVMH and Arnault’s fortunes.</p></div><div class=\"clearboth\">Published: 10:43 AM GMT · 15 Mar 2025</div><a href=\"https://jaimemontoya.com/opinion/\">Richest companies and people since 2024-Dec-21, including Jaime Montoya's stock market, business & finance opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT</a></p><div id=\"richest-company\"></div><div id=\"richest-people\"></div><div id=\"jaime-montoya-capital\"></div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ol><li><a href=\"about/\">About</a>: My one-page resume.<li><a href=\"blog/\">Blog</a>: Software technical documentation blog for myself and the world.<li><a href=\"book/\">Book reviews</a>: My reviews for some of the books I have read from cover to cover.<li><a href=\"capital/\">Capital</a>: Capital history in my records since May 5, 2024.<li><a href=\"coursera/\">Coursera</a>: Coursera courses I have successfully completed.<li><a href=\"finances/\">Finances</a>: Personal finance software I have created.<li><a href=\"investment\">Investment</a>: Mutual fund and stock investments I have made since April 12, 2024.<li><a href=\"market/\">Market</a>: Monitoring tool to beat the market.<li><a href=\"news/\">News</a>: Personal news since November 7, 2024, 00:00 AM GMT.<li><a href=\"opinion/\">Opinion</a>: Stock Market, Business & Finance Opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT.<li><a href=\"portfolio/\">Portfolio</a>: Websites I have created, designed, developed, upgraded, maintained and/or hosted.<li><a href=\"reading/\">Reading</a>: Listing all of the books I have read from cover to cover since August 31, 2018.<li><a href=\"run/\">Running</a>: Running history I have endured since August 2, 2020.<li><a href=\"teaching/\">Teaching</a>: In-person classes I have taught.<li><a href=\"weight/\">Weight</a>: Weight history from my body since October 19, 2019.</ol></p>";
