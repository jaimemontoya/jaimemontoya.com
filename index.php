TSMC richer than Tesla. Buffet enjoying a great 2025. Arnault in alarming freefall. Ortega richer than Ballmer.</a></h2><div class=\"floatleft\"><img src=\"/opinion/2025/04/01/03/51/img/20250401-0351-collage.jpg\" alt=\"20250401-0351-collage\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" class=\"floatleft\"><p>Considering the current situation in the U.S. stock market, Apple is could be said that Apple is having an outstanding performance since 14 Mar 2025.</p><p>Tesla started a new week again in a falling trajectory. The year to date performance for Tesla is -31.67%. TSMC is richer than Tesla after TSMC moved from 10th to 9th, while Tesla was downgraded from 9th to 10th, in the ranking of richest companies in the world.</p><p>Warren Buffet is having an impressive 2025 for his net worth in the middle of the alarming U.S. market patterns since Donald Trump took office for his second presidential term. The year to date performance for his company, Berkshire Hathaway, is 18.06%, while many other top richest companies are in negative share price numbers for 2025.</p><p>Bernard Arnault is in a freefall trajectory of massive losses for his net worth. This negative path started on 28 Jan 2025 and it has not stopped yet.</p><p>Amancio Ortega is richer than Steve Ballmer in a financial environment that is volatile, but where Ballmer may not be in the best shape as Microsoft, as a technology company, has a disadvantage to thrive when the economy is weak. That is considering that high-tech companies could be classified as risky, not defensive stocks, in times of political and financial uncertainty.</p></div><div class=\"clearboth\">Published: 3:51 AM GMT · 1 Apr 2025</div><a href=\"https://jaimemontoya.com/opinion/\">Richest companies and people since 2024-Dec-21, including Jaime Montoya's stock market, business & finance opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT</a></p><div id=\"richest-company\"></div><div id=\"richest-people\"></div><div id=\"jaime-montoya-capital\"></div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ol><li><a href=\"about/\">About</a>: My one-page resume.<li><a href=\"blog/\">Blog</a>: Software technical documentation blog for myself and the world.<li><a href=\"book/\">Book reviews</a>: My reviews for some of the books I have read from cover to cover.<li><a href=\"capital/\">Capital</a>: Capital history in my records since May 5, 2024.<li><a href=\"coursera/\">Coursera</a>: Coursera courses I have successfully completed.<li><a href=\"finances/\">Finances</a>: Personal finance software I have created.<li><a href=\"investment\">Investment</a>: Mutual fund and stock investments I have made since April 12, 2024.<li><a href=\"market/\">Market</a>: Monitoring tool to beat the market.<li><a href=\"news/\">News</a>: Personal news since November 7, 2024, 00:00 AM GMT.<li><a href=\"opinion/\">Opinion</a>: Stock Market, Business & Finance Opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT.<li><a href=\"portfolio/\">Portfolio</a>: Websites I have created, designed, developed, upgraded, maintained and/or hosted.<li><a href=\"reading/\">Reading</a>: Listing all of the books I have read from cover to cover since August 31, 2018.<li><a href=\"run/\">Running</a>: Running history I have endured since August 2, 2020.<li><a href=\"teaching/\">Teaching</a>: In-person classes I have taught.<li><a href=\"weight/\">Weight</a>: Weight history from my body since October 19, 2019.</ol></p>";
