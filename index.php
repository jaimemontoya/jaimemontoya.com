Broadcom started the week with negative results. Nvidia richer than Microsoft. Musk had a wonderful Monday. Arnault still lagging in 2025.</a></h2><div class=\"floatleft\"><img src=\"/opinion/2025/03/25/05/14/img/20250325-0514-collage.jpg\" alt=\"20250325-0514-collage\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" class=\"floatleft\"><p>Meta has been in a share price growth trajectory since 19 Mar 2025. That is good news for the company because from 18 Feb to 18 Mar 2025, Meta experienced a full month of share price fall. The reason why Meta had such a great beginning of a new week may be because in partnership with the Indian multinational conglomerate Reliance Industries Limited, Meta is apparently planning to build the largest AI data center in the world. Meta is a leader in the AI revolution and that contributes to the success of the company, which is now in the positive territory again for its 2025 share price, considering its year to date performance.</p><p>Broadcom has had an approximately flat share price since 7 Mar 2025. The volatility of the company is well-known. Considering the tumultuous few months for the stock market since President Donald Trump started his term in the United States, mainly as a result of uncertainty, a flat share price is probably good news. Broadcom has great potential in the AI revolution.</p><p>Nvidia is richer than Microsoft again. Nvidia was upgraded from 3rd to 2nd, while Microsoft was downgraded from 2nd to 3rd, in the ranking of richest companies in the world. Nvidia is well-known for its high volatility. The challenge for the company is to remain in that great position for more than just a couple of days</p><p>Elon Musk enjoyed a great Monday for his net worth after so many continuous nightmares for several weeks in a row. His fortune increased by 4.99%, which translates to $16.7 billion. This is likely to be the result, at least partially, of the hope that the Trump administration will not execute a broader set of tariffs that had been initially anticipated. In addition, the news about Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) feature in China was positive to investors. Also, news about the potential expansion of Tesla in the Indian market may have encouraged investors.</p><p>Bernard Arnault is still suffering a bad performance in 2025 for his net worth. His company, LVHM, has suffered a year to date performance of -6.15%. LVMH stock has lagged since the beginning of March 2025.</p></div><div class=\"clearboth\">Published: 5:14 AM GMT · 25 Mar 2025</div><a href=\"https://jaimemontoya.com/opinion/\">Richest companies and people since 2024-Dec-21, including Jaime Montoya's stock market, business & finance opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT</a></p><div id=\"richest-company\"></div><div id=\"richest-people\"></div><div id=\"jaime-montoya-capital\"></div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ol><li><a href=\"about/\">About</a>: My one-page resume.<li><a href=\"blog/\">Blog</a>: Software technical documentation blog for myself and the world.<li><a href=\"book/\">Book reviews</a>: My reviews for some of the books I have read from cover to cover.<li><a href=\"capital/\">Capital</a>: Capital history in my records since May 5, 2024.<li><a href=\"coursera/\">Coursera</a>: Coursera courses I have successfully completed.<li><a href=\"finances/\">Finances</a>: Personal finance software I have created.<li><a href=\"investment\">Investment</a>: Mutual fund and stock investments I have made since April 12, 2024.<li><a href=\"market/\">Market</a>: Monitoring tool to beat the market.<li><a href=\"news/\">News</a>: Personal news since November 7, 2024, 00:00 AM GMT.<li><a href=\"opinion/\">Opinion</a>: Stock Market, Business & Finance Opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT.<li><a href=\"portfolio/\">Portfolio</a>: Websites I have created, designed, developed, upgraded, maintained and/or hosted.<li><a href=\"reading/\">Reading</a>: Listing all of the books I have read from cover to cover since August 31, 2018.<li><a href=\"run/\">Running</a>: Running history I have endured since August 2, 2020.<li><a href=\"teaching/\">Teaching</a>: In-person classes I have taught.<li><a href=\"weight/\">Weight</a>: Weight history from my body since October 19, 2019.</ol></p>";
