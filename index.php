Now the company is below the $1 trillion mark in market capitalization. Tesla was downgraded one spot from 9th to 10th richest company in the world, replaced by TSMC which moved up from 10th to 9th. TSMC had negative stock price results on Tuesday, but the catastrophic day of Tesla allowed TSMC to be upgraded one place. In the process, Elon Musk lost $15.6 billion on Tuesday.</p><p>Saudi Aramco had a positive stock price growth of 0.74% on Tuesday, better than all Magnificent 7 stocks (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla).</p><p>The positive net worth growth continued on Tuesday for Warren Buffett, who is in good shape to consolidate himself as the 6th richest person in the world, still richer than the Google founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin.</p><p>The weak performance of Meta in the stock market during the last few days, made it unsustainable for Mark Zuckerberg to remain as the second richest person in the world, and now he was downgraded one spot to 3rd place, with Jeff Bezos going back to 2nd place after being upgraded one spot on Tuesday.</p></div><div class=\"clearboth\">Published: 3:33 PM GMT · 26 Feb 2025</div><a href=\"https://jaimemontoya.com/opinion/\">Richest companies and people since 2024-Dec-21, including Jaime Montoya's stock market, business & finance opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT</a></p><div id=\"richest-company\"></div><div id=\"richest-people\"></div><div id=\"jaime-montoya-capital\"></div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ol><li><a href=\"about/\">About</a>: My one-page resume.<li><a href=\"blog/\">Blog</a>: Software technical documentation blog for myself and the world.<li><a href=\"book/\">Book reviews</a>: My reviews for some of the books I have read from cover to cover.<li><a href=\"capital/\">Capital</a>: Capital history in my records since May 5, 2024.<li><a href=\"coursera/\">Coursera</a>: Coursera courses I have successfully completed.<li><a href=\"finances/\">Finances</a>: Personal finance software I have created.<li><a href=\"investment\">Investment</a>: Mutual fund and stock investments I have made since April 12, 2024.<li><a href=\"market/\">Market</a>: Monitoring tool to beat the market.<li><a href=\"news/\">News</a>: Personal news since November 7, 2024, 00:00 AM GMT.<li><a href=\"opinion/\">Opinion</a>: Stock Market, Business & Finance Opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT.<li><a href=\"portfolio/\">Portfolio</a>: Websites I have created, designed, developed, upgraded, maintained and/or hosted.<li><a href=\"reading/\">Reading</a>: Listing all of the books I have read from cover to cover since August 31, 2018.<li><a href=\"run/\">Running</a>: Running history I have endured since August 2, 2020.<li><a href=\"teaching/\">Teaching</a>: In-person classes I have taught.<li><a href=\"weight/\">Weight</a>: Weight history from my body since October 19, 2019.</ol></p>";
