Alarming last 365 days performance for Saudi Aramco. Positive March for Alphabet. Alphabet richer than Amazon. Broadcom richer than Tesla. Arnault suffering a net worth freefall in March. Ellison finally interrupting on Friday his negative net worth trajectory.</a></h2><div class=\"floatleft\"><img src=\"/opinion/2025/03/08/11/23/img/20250308-1123-collage.jpg\" alt=\"20250308-1123-collage\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" class=\"floatleft\"><p>The first-quarter earnings for Broadcom were outstanding, offering guidance that suggested positive ongoing results and future artificial intelligence demand. One great day was not expected to save the negative 2025 results for Broadcom stock price, which has fallen by 15.96% in 2025. As a result, Broadcam was upgraded from 11th to 10th richest company in the world, while Tesla fell one position, from 10th to 11th. The downhill for Tesla continues.</p><p>Saudi Aramco has been experiencing a significant stock price fall since 4 Mar 2025. The company is still one of the richest in the world, but its stock results in the last 365 days have been alarmingly negative: a 18.48% decrease.</p><p>Alphabet is finally starting to grow in 2025, with its March stock experiencing a positive trajectory after a catastrophic February. Amazon also experienced a disastrous February 2025, but its numbers in March are still in freefall trajectory. As a result, Alphabet is again richer than Amazon, with Alphabet upgraded from 5th to 4th in the ranking of richest companies in the world, while Amazon fell from 4th to 5th. Amazon had become richer than Alphabet on 4 Feb 2025, but now the results are reversed.</p><p>Friday was not a good day for Bernard Arnault’s net worth, when he lost $4.9 billion. Since the beginning of March 2025, his company LVMH has been in a freefall trajectory.</p><p>For Larry Ellison, Friday was positive for his net worth, with his company, Oracle, increasing its stock price by 2.80%. The negative stock trajectory for Oracle had started on 27 Feb 2025. The company finally interrupted, at least for one day on Friday, that negative stock price direction.</p></div><div class=\"clearboth\">Published: 11:23 AM GMT · 8 Mar 2025</div><a href=\"https://jaimemontoya.com/opinion/\">Richest companies and people since 2024-Dec-21, including Jaime Montoya's stock market, business & finance opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT</a></p><div id=\"richest-company\"></div><div id=\"richest-people\"></div><div id=\"jaime-montoya-capital\"></div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ol><li><a href=\"about/\">About</a>: My one-page resume.<li><a href=\"blog/\">Blog</a>: Software technical documentation blog for myself and the world.<li><a href=\"book/\">Book reviews</a>: My reviews for some of the books I have read from cover to cover.<li><a href=\"capital/\">Capital</a>: Capital history in my records since May 5, 2024.<li><a href=\"coursera/\">Coursera</a>: Coursera courses I have successfully completed.<li><a href=\"finances/\">Finances</a>: Personal finance software I have created.<li><a href=\"investment\">Investment</a>: Mutual fund and stock investments I have made since April 12, 2024.<li><a href=\"market/\">Market</a>: Monitoring tool to beat the market.<li><a href=\"news/\">News</a>: Personal news since November 7, 2024, 00:00 AM GMT.<li><a href=\"opinion/\">Opinion</a>: Stock Market, Business & Finance Opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT.<li><a href=\"portfolio/\">Portfolio</a>: Websites I have created, designed, developed, upgraded, maintained and/or hosted.<li><a href=\"reading/\">Reading</a>: Listing all of the books I have read from cover to cover since August 31, 2018.<li><a href=\"run/\">Running</a>: Running history I have endured since August 2, 2020.<li><a href=\"teaching/\">Teaching</a>: In-person classes I have taught.<li><a href=\"weight/\">Weight</a>: Weight history from my body since October 19, 2019.</ol></p>";
