Broadcom experienced heavy share price decline. Amazon richer than Alphabet. Musk losing money at alarming rate. Buffett consistently increasing his wealth even during difficult times. Bezos richer than Zuckerberg.</a></h2><div class=\"floatleft\"><img src=\"/opinion/2025/03/11/12/00/img/20250311-1200-collage.jpg\" alt=\"20250311-1200-collage\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" class=\"floatleft\"><p>Berkshire Hathaway has experienced a solid stock price growth of 10.20% in 2025. Even in the uncertain times of political changes in the U.S., and the trade war fears, Berkshire Hathaway is increasing its wealth and navigating the crisis with successful results. Warren Buffett keeps increasing his wealth even during unpredictable times.</p><p>Broadcom started the week with a 5.39% stock price decline, which is not surprising considering the terrible Monday in the U.S. stock market. As a technology company, fears about where the economy will go in 2025, can easily affect the technology sector.</p><p>Amazon is richer than Alphabet. Amazon was upgraded one stop from 5th to 4th, in the ranking of richest companies in the world, while Alphabet was downgraded from 4th to 5th. The competition to win, for now, is more about what company is losing less, rather than what company is winning money, in a difficult economic outlook under the new Trump administration.</p><p>Elon Musk continues experiencing alarming declines for his net worth. Every single week since President Trump's inauguration in January, Tesla has experienced a price share fall.</p><p>Jeff Bezos is again richer than Mark Zuckerberg, with Bezos being the 2nd richest person in the world now, and Zuckerberg, number 3. They switched positions today. There is nothing extraordinary that Bezos and Amazon did today to achieve that, other than losing less money than Meta and Zuckerberg, in another terrible day in 2025 for the U.S. stock market.</p></div><div class=\"clearboth\">Published: 12:00 PM GMT · 11 Mar 2025</div><a href=\"https://jaimemontoya.com/opinion/\">Richest companies and people since 2024-Dec-21, including Jaime Montoya's stock market, business & finance opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT</a></p><div id=\"richest-company\"></div><div id=\"richest-people\"></div><div id=\"jaime-montoya-capital\"></div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ol><li><a href=\"about/\">About</a>: My one-page resume.<li><a href=\"blog/\">Blog</a>: Software technical documentation blog for myself and the world.<li><a href=\"book/\">Book reviews</a>: My reviews for some of the books I have read from cover to cover.<li><a href=\"capital/\">Capital</a>: Capital history in my records since May 5, 2024.<li><a href=\"coursera/\">Coursera</a>: Coursera courses I have successfully completed.<li><a href=\"finances/\">Finances</a>: Personal finance software I have created.<li><a href=\"investment\">Investment</a>: Mutual fund and stock investments I have made since April 12, 2024.<li><a href=\"market/\">Market</a>: Monitoring tool to beat the market.<li><a href=\"news/\">News</a>: Personal news since November 7, 2024, 00:00 AM GMT.<li><a href=\"opinion/\">Opinion</a>: Stock Market, Business & Finance Opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT.<li><a href=\"portfolio/\">Portfolio</a>: Websites I have created, designed, developed, upgraded, maintained and/or hosted.<li><a href=\"reading/\">Reading</a>: Listing all of the books I have read from cover to cover since August 31, 2018.<li><a href=\"run/\">Running</a>: Running history I have endured since August 2, 2020.<li><a href=\"teaching/\">Teaching</a>: In-person classes I have taught.<li><a href=\"weight/\">Weight</a>: Weight history from my body since October 19, 2019.</ol></p>";
