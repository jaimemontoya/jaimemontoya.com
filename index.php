Investors finding value in Broadcom stock. Good Tuesday for Musk, finally. Ellison losing money as Oracle did not meet expectations after reporting quarterly results.</a></h2><div class=\"floatleft\"><img src=\"/opinion/2025/03/12/00/09/img/20250312-0009-collage.jpg\" alt=\"20250312-0009-collage\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" class=\"floatleft\"><p>Apple shares fell 2.92% on Tuesday. This was probably the result of news that certain AI-driven Siri features would have a rollout delay. The plan is to launch those features in 2026. The expectation was for this to happen around April or the spring of 2025. Analysts believe this could hurt iPhone sales.</p><p>Broadcom had a great Tuesday for its share price, but Monday had been terrible. The company lost more on Monday than it won on Tuesday. This may suggest investors seeing value in stocks that are facing declines, but that have high value, such as Broadcom. That would align to the strategy of buy low, sell high.</p><p>Tuesday was finally a day of growth for Elon Musk’s net worth. Nonetheless, this could simply mean that investors are seeing the opportunity to buy low, predicting potential in Tesla for the artificial intelligence and robotics future that the company could revolutionize or at least, participate in the revolution. 2025 is still a nightmare for Elon Musk and Tesla.</p><p>Oracle reported its quarterly results, falling short of expectations. But the company has a strong outlook and ambitious future projects. The fortune of Larry Ellison was reduced by 2.52% on Tuesday.</p></div><div class=\"clearboth\">Published: 12:09 AM GMT · 11 Mar 2025</div><a href=\"https://jaimemontoya.com/opinion/\">Richest companies and people since 2024-Dec-21, including Jaime Montoya's stock market, business & finance opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT</a></p><div id=\"richest-company\"></div><div id=\"richest-people\"></div><div id=\"jaime-montoya-capital\"></div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ol><li><a href=\"about/\">About</a>: My one-page resume.<li><a href=\"blog/\">Blog</a>: Software technical documentation blog for myself and the world.<li><a href=\"book/\">Book reviews</a>: My reviews for some of the books I have read from cover to cover.<li><a href=\"capital/\">Capital</a>: Capital history in my records since May 5, 2024.<li><a href=\"coursera/\">Coursera</a>: Coursera courses I have successfully completed.<li><a href=\"finances/\">Finances</a>: Personal finance software I have created.<li><a href=\"investment\">Investment</a>: Mutual fund and stock investments I have made since April 12, 2024.<li><a href=\"market/\">Market</a>: Monitoring tool to beat the market.<li><a href=\"news/\">News</a>: Personal news since November 7, 2024, 00:00 AM GMT.<li><a href=\"opinion/\">Opinion</a>: Stock Market, Business & Finance Opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT.<li><a href=\"portfolio/\">Portfolio</a>: Websites I have created, designed, developed, upgraded, maintained and/or hosted.<li><a href=\"reading/\">Reading</a>: Listing all of the books I have read from cover to cover since August 31, 2018.<li><a href=\"run/\">Running</a>: Running history I have endured since August 2, 2020.<li><a href=\"teaching/\">Teaching</a>: In-person classes I have taught.<li><a href=\"weight/\">Weight</a>: Weight history from my body since October 19, 2019.</ol></p>";
