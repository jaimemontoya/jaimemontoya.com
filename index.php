Nvidia disappointing investors. Ellison is suffering the 2025 fall of the tech sector stock.</a></h2><div class=\"floatleft\"><img src=\"/opinion/2025/02/28/07/45/img/20250228-0745-collage.jpg\" alt=\"20250228-0745-collage\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" class=\"floatleft\"><p>The year to date growth for Berkshire Hathaway is 11.37% for its stock price. Warren Buffett increased his net worth by 1.66% on Thursday, resulting in $2.6 billion for his fortune. His company is having a solid and successful 2025.</p><p>AI stocks suffered a bad Thursday. The irony was that on Wednesday, Nvidia earnings topped expectations because AI demand was supposedly going to grow. The fiscal fourth-quarter earnings for Nvidia, exceeded analysts' expectations. But then on Thursday, Nvidia's stock price fell 8.48%, which could be interpreted as investors saying that Nvidia’s results were not good enough. Maybe the problem with Nvidia stock is that investors are used to exponential growth and might possibly have excessive expectations that Nvidia’s stock will grow at the same rate indefinitely. But the reality is, Nvidia is currently the second richest company in the world by market capitalization. At this point, Nvidia is no longer a small or medium-sized company that would normally double or triple its stock price in a year. Maybe investors are used to those days when Nvidia was unstoppable growing at a rate that was difficult to match. That is not to say that it is the investor’s fault. They own their money and can invest it in Nvidia’s stock or anywhere they want. In the meantime, it is a big question mark what the situation will be in 2025 for Nvidia. Currently, the year to date balance for the company in 2025 is -13.13%, an alarming negative number for Nvidia’s stock price.</p><p>As Oracle experienced a 4.47% fall for its stock price on Thursday, Larry Ellison lost $8.7 billing on that same day, a decrease of 4.10%. The year to date balance for Oracle in 2025 is -0.76%. A negative number showing how the company is having a difficult year for now. Oracle had been above the $0.5 trillion mark this year, but now it is at $460.82 billion in market capitalization.</p><p>The technology sector has been suffering a poor performance in 2025, with the S&P 500 having a 0.2% growth, contrasted with a -5.3% growth for the technology sector. Maybe investors are bracing for uncertainty under the Trump’s administration. Technology would not be expected to be a sector that performs well in times of economic uncertainty and fears about the growth of the economy. Probably many investors are moving their financial securities to safer assets like government bonds, and selling their technology stocks.</p></div><div class=\"clearboth\">Published: 7:45 PM GMT · 28 Feb 2025</div><a href=\"https://jaimemontoya.com/opinion/\">Richest companies and people since 2024-Dec-21, including Jaime Montoya's stock market, business & finance opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT</a></p><div id=\"richest-company\"></div><div id=\"richest-people\"></div><div id=\"jaime-montoya-capital\"></div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ol><li><a href=\"about/\">About</a>: My one-page resume.<li><a href=\"blog/\">Blog</a>: Software technical documentation blog for myself and the world.<li><a href=\"book/\">Book reviews</a>: My reviews for some of the books I have read from cover to cover.<li><a href=\"capital/\">Capital</a>: Capital history in my records since May 5, 2024.<li><a href=\"coursera/\">Coursera</a>: Coursera courses I have successfully completed.<li><a href=\"finances/\">Finances</a>: Personal finance software I have created.<li><a href=\"investment\">Investment</a>: Mutual fund and stock investments I have made since April 12, 2024.<li><a href=\"market/\">Market</a>: Monitoring tool to beat the market.<li><a href=\"news/\">News</a>: Personal news since November 7, 2024, 00:00 AM GMT.<li><a href=\"opinion/\">Opinion</a>: Stock Market, Business & Finance Opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT.<li><a href=\"portfolio/\">Portfolio</a>: Websites I have created, designed, developed, upgraded, maintained and/or hosted.<li><a href=\"reading/\">Reading</a>: Listing all of the books I have read from cover to cover since August 31, 2018.<li><a href=\"run/\">Running</a>: Running history I have endured since August 2, 2020.<li><a href=\"teaching/\">Teaching</a>: In-person classes I have taught.<li><a href=\"weight/\">Weight</a>: Weight history from my body since October 19, 2019.</ol></p>";
