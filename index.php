Historically great results for Berkshire Hathaway. Buffett increased his net worth by $5.9 billion. Tesla continues with its poor 2025 performance. TSMC richer than Broadcom. Zuckerberg lost $5.3 billion on Monday.</a></h2><div class=\"floatleft\"><img src=\"/opinion/2025/02/25/00/38/img/20250225-0038-collage.jpg\" alt=\"20250225-0038-collage\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" class=\"floatleft\"><p>Monday was an extraordinary day for Berkshire Hathaway in the stock market, with a 4.11% price increase. As a result, Berkshire Hathaway is richer than Tesla, where Berkshire Hathaway was upgraded one spot to the 8th position, and Tesla was downgraded to the 9th place in the ranking of richest companies in the world by market capitalization. Warren Buffett’s net worth grew by $5.9 billion on Monday. Buffett bragged about Berkshire’s Record Tax Payment: “Berkshire would not have achieved its results in any locale except America whereas America would have been every bit the success it has been if Berkshire had never existed. So thank you, Uncle Sam.”</p><p>Tesla has a -12.85% stock price performance in 2025. That is bad news for the company that became, on Monday, poorer than Berkshire Hathaway.</p><p>TSMC is now richer than Broadcom, with TSMC as the 10th richest company in the world, while Broadcom is number 11. Ironically, this happened in a day when both companies fell more than 3% in their stock price. But the fall for Broadcom was much higher (4.91%). TSMC just had a smaller stock price fall than Broadcom, and that was the only reason why it was upgraded one spot in the ranking of richest companies.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg decreased his net worth on Monday by $5.3 billion. Meta is in free fall mode now, a negative trajectory that started on 18 Feb 2025.</p></div><div class=\"clearboth\">Published: 12:38 PM GMT · 25 Feb 2025</div><a href=\"https://jaimemontoya.com/opinion/\">Richest companies and people since 2024-Dec-21, including Jaime Montoya's stock market, business & finance opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT</a></p><div id=\"richest-company\"></div><div id=\"richest-people\"></div><div id=\"jaime-montoya-capital\"></div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ol><li><a href=\"about/\">About</a>: My one-page resume.<li><a href=\"blog/\">Blog</a>: Software technical documentation blog for myself and the world.<li><a href=\"book/\">Book reviews</a>: My reviews for some of the books I have read from cover to cover.<li><a href=\"capital/\">Capital</a>: Capital history in my records since May 5, 2024.<li><a href=\"coursera/\">Coursera</a>: Coursera courses I have successfully completed.<li><a href=\"finances/\">Finances</a>: Personal finance software I have created.<li><a href=\"investment\">Investment</a>: Mutual fund and stock investments I have made since April 12, 2024.<li><a href=\"market/\">Market</a>: Monitoring tool to beat the market.<li><a href=\"news/\">News</a>: Personal news since November 7, 2024, 00:00 AM GMT.<li><a href=\"opinion/\">Opinion</a>: Stock Market, Business & Finance Opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT.<li><a href=\"portfolio/\">Portfolio</a>: Websites I have created, designed, developed, upgraded, maintained and/or hosted.<li><a href=\"reading/\">Reading</a>: Listing all of the books I have read from cover to cover since August 31, 2018.<li><a href=\"run/\">Running</a>: Running history I have endured since August 2, 2020.<li><a href=\"teaching/\">Teaching</a>: In-person classes I have taught.<li><a href=\"weight/\">Weight</a>: Weight history from my body since October 19, 2019.</ol></p>";
