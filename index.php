TSMC richer than Tesla. Arnault in steady trajectory of fortune decline. Zuckerberg finally having a good day for his net worth.

The reason is the fact that Apple produces many of its products in a country heavily affected by the tariffs: China. The dependence on China for Apple to make its products is devastating in the current political environment of tariffs. That is not difficult to explain considering that Apple is producing and assembling 90% of iPhones in China. It is virtually impossible for Apple to move its manufacturing presence from China to the United States without significant, if not total disruption.</p><p>Volatility continues for Nvidia, and Monday was a good day for the company in the stock market.</p><p>In the current turbulent times in the markets, TSMC is again richer than Tesla, with TSMC enjoying an upgrade from 10th to 9th, and Tesla suffering a downgrade from 9th to 10th in the ranking of richest companies in the world.</p><p>Bernard Arnault is in a steady trajectory of decline for his fortune. The last day that the stock price for the company closed at a value below its current price was in January 2021. That reveals how devastating the losses are for LVMH and in consequence, for Arnault.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg finally had a good day for his fortune, but his company, Meta, has been in steady share price decline from 18 Feb 2025.</p><p>Steve Ballmer is richer than Amancio Ortega, with Ballmer having an upgrade from 10th to 9th, and Ortega being downgraded from 9th to 10th in the ranking of richest people in the world.</p></div><div class=\"clearboth\">Published: 12:18 PM GMT · 8 Apr 2025</div><a href=\"https://jaimemontoya.com/opinion/\">Richest companies and people since 2024-Dec-21, including Jaime Montoya's stock market, business & finance opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT</a></p><div id=\"richest-company\"></div><div id=\"richest-people\"></div><div id=\"jaime-montoya-capital\"></div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ol><li><a href=\"about/\">About</a>: My one-page resume.<li><a href=\"blog/\">Blog</a>: Software technical documentation blog for myself and the world.<li><a href=\"book/\">Book reviews</a>: My reviews for some of the books I have read from cover to cover.<li><a href=\"capital/\">Capital</a>: Capital history in my records since May 5, 2024.<li><a href=\"coursera/\">Coursera</a>: Coursera courses I have successfully completed.<li><a href=\"finances/\">Finances</a>: Personal finance software I have created.<li><a href=\"investment\">Investment</a>: Mutual fund and stock investments I have made since April 12, 2024.<li><a href=\"market/\">Market</a>: Monitoring tool to beat the market.<li><a href=\"news/\">News</a>: Personal news since November 7, 2024, 00:00 AM GMT.<li><a href=\"opinion/\">Opinion</a>: Stock Market, Business & Finance Opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT.<li><a href=\"portfolio/\">Portfolio</a>: Websites I have created, designed, developed, upgraded, maintained and/or hosted.<li><a href=\"reading/\">Reading</a>: Listing all of the books I have read from cover to cover since August 31, 2018.<li><a href=\"run/\">Running</a>: Running history I have endured since August 2, 2020.<li><a href=\"teaching/\">Teaching</a>: In-person classes I have taught.<li><a href=\"weight/\">Weight</a>: Weight history from my body since October 19, 2019.</ol></p>";
