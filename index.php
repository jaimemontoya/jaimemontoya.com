Meta in negative territory. Broadcom richer than TSMC. Ortega richer than Ballmer. Arnault in a pattern of decline.</a></h2><div class=\"floatleft\"><img src=\"/opinion/2025/03/20/12/52/img/20250320-1252-collage.jpg\" alt=\"20250320-1252-collage\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" class=\"floatleft\"><p>Broadcom is a highly volatile company and as typical of its stock price volatility, Wednesday was a good day for the company. As a result, Broadcom is again richer than TSMC, with Broadcom upgraded from 10th to 9th, and TSMC downgraded from 9th to 10th in the ranking of richest companies in the world. At this pace maybe Broadcom could challenge Nvidia and take more territory in the market share competing for supremacy in the computer chips industry and AI revolution.</p><p>Meta had a negative Wednesday for its stock price, which was the last straw to bring the company into negative territory for 2025. The result was that Meta joined all Magnificent 7 Stock companies in the trajectory of negative 2025. Meta was the only one still in positive territory, from that list of 7 giants leading the markets a few months ago (Meta Platforms, Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, and Tesla).</p><p>Amancio Ortega is in a positive trajectory of growth since 14 Mar 2025 for his net worth. His company Inditex is consistently growing and recovering from the fall and steady decline it has experienced from 19 Feb to 13 Mar 2025. Being primarily outside of the U.S. as the headquarters of the company, might be beneficial for Ortega and his empire now that the U.S. is having a period of political transitions and uncertainty. In the process, Ortega has become richer than Steve Ballmer, where Ortega was upgraded from 10th to 9th richest person on the planet, while Baller was downgraded from 9th to 10th.</p><p>Bernard Arnault did not have a good Wednesday for the growth of his fortune. His company has experienced relatively flat share price results since 13 Mar 2025, which is good news when contrasted with the consistent and alarming decline it had been suffering from 3 to 13 Mar 2025. During those 10 days of decline, the LVMH price went from $690.80 to $605.00. That is, ($690.80 - $605.00) ÷ $690.80 * 100 = 12.42% decline. That is a significant loss in 10 days. But the fact that since 13 Mar 2025, the company is no longer in a falling trajectory, is good news for Arnault.</p></div><div class=\"clearboth\">Published: 12:52 PM GMT · 20 Mar 2025</div><a href=\"https://jaimemontoya.com/opinion/\">Richest companies and people since 2024-Dec-21, including Jaime Montoya's stock market, business & finance opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT</a></p><div id=\"richest-company\"></div><div id=\"richest-people\"></div><div id=\"jaime-montoya-capital\"></div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ol><li><a href=\"about/\">About</a>: My one-page resume.<li><a href=\"blog/\">Blog</a>: Software technical documentation blog for myself and the world.<li><a href=\"book/\">Book reviews</a>: My reviews for some of the books I have read from cover to cover.<li><a href=\"capital/\">Capital</a>: Capital history in my records since May 5, 2024.<li><a href=\"coursera/\">Coursera</a>: Coursera courses I have successfully completed.<li><a href=\"finances/\">Finances</a>: Personal finance software I have created.<li><a href=\"investment\">Investment</a>: Mutual fund and stock investments I have made since April 12, 2024.<li><a href=\"market/\">Market</a>: Monitoring tool to beat the market.<li><a href=\"news/\">News</a>: Personal news since November 7, 2024, 00:00 AM GMT.<li><a href=\"opinion/\">Opinion</a>: Stock Market, Business & Finance Opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT.<li><a href=\"portfolio/\">Portfolio</a>: Websites I have created, designed, developed, upgraded, maintained and/or hosted.<li><a href=\"reading/\">Reading</a>: Listing all of the books I have read from cover to cover since August 31, 2018.<li><a href=\"run/\">Running</a>: Running history I have endured since August 2, 2020.<li><a href=\"teaching/\">Teaching</a>: In-person classes I have taught.<li><a href=\"weight/\">Weight</a>: Weight history from my body since October 19, 2019.</ol></p>";
