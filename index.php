Tesla richer than TSMC. TSMC suffering a challenging 2025. Buffett enjoying a great 2025 during times of global financial crisis. Page losing money this year.</a></h2><div class=\"floatleft\"><img src=\"/opinion/2025/03/28/04/50/img/20250328-0450-collage.jpg\" alt=\"20250328-0450-collage\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" class=\"floatleft\"><p>The share price for Apple has been in a positive trajectory since 14 Mar 2025. 2025 has been difficult for the technology sector, but Apple is managing to remain number one as the most valuable company on the planet, even during times of economic crisis, at least a crisis for the stock market, if not for the entire U.S. economy.</p><p>TSMC is yet another company struggling to have share price growth in 2025. The decline in recent days has been enough to allow Tesla to become richer than TSMC. Tesla is now the 9th richest company in the world, being upgraded one spot, while TSMC was downgraded from the 9th to the 10th place.</p><p>The net worth of Warren Buffett is growing steadily in 2025. His company, Berkshire Hathaway is the only one in the last 30 days with a positive stock price growth value from the list of top 10 richest companies. It is remarkable the success of this company in 2025, when many other companies are suffering the stock price declines that are affecting the U.S. stock market this year.</p><p>Larry Page saw his fortune decline by 1.66% on Thursday. The share price for Alphabet has suffered a decline of -1.86% in the last six months. The decline started on 5 Feb 2025. Two main reasons can be associated with this decline: 1) A weak Alphabet’s fourth-quarter earnings report, from the perspective of investors. 2) Concerns about the global economy.</p></div><div class=\"clearboth\">Published: 4:50 AM GMT · 28 Mar 2025</div><a href=\"https://jaimemontoya.com/opinion/\">Richest companies and people since 2024-Dec-21, including Jaime Montoya's stock market, business & finance opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT</a></p><div id=\"richest-company\"></div><div id=\"richest-people\"></div><div id=\"jaime-montoya-capital\"></div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ol><li><a href=\"about/\">About</a>: My one-page resume.<li><a href=\"blog/\">Blog</a>: Software technical documentation blog for myself and the world.<li><a href=\"book/\">Book reviews</a>: My reviews for some of the books I have read from cover to cover.<li><a href=\"capital/\">Capital</a>: Capital history in my records since May 5, 2024.<li><a href=\"coursera/\">Coursera</a>: Coursera courses I have successfully completed.<li><a href=\"finances/\">Finances</a>: Personal finance software I have created.<li><a href=\"investment\">Investment</a>: Mutual fund and stock investments I have made since April 12, 2024.<li><a href=\"market/\">Market</a>: Monitoring tool to beat the market.<li><a href=\"news/\">News</a>: Personal news since November 7, 2024, 00:00 AM GMT.<li><a href=\"opinion/\">Opinion</a>: Stock Market, Business & Finance Opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT.<li><a href=\"portfolio/\">Portfolio</a>: Websites I have created, designed, developed, upgraded, maintained and/or hosted.<li><a href=\"reading/\">Reading</a>: Listing all of the books I have read from cover to cover since August 31, 2018.<li><a href=\"run/\">Running</a>: Running history I have endured since August 2, 2020.<li><a href=\"teaching/\">Teaching</a>: In-person classes I have taught.<li><a href=\"weight/\">Weight</a>: Weight history from my body since October 19, 2019.</ol></p>";
