Meta’s record 20-day streak came to an end making Zuckerberg lose $6.9 billion. Ellison increased his wealth by $6 billion. Ballmer richer than Walton.</a></h2><div class=\"floatleft\"><img src=\"/opinion/2025/02/19/09/21/img/20250219-0921-collage.jpg\" alt=\"20250219-0921-collage\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" class=\"floatleft\"><p>Nvidia’s stock price is, in February 2025, recovering from its January 2025 DeepSeek losses. The future is looking promising again for Nvidia.</p><p>Meta’s record 20-day streak came to an end Tuesday, when Meta’s stock price fell 2.76%. No obvious reason for Meta’s fall on Tuesday, other than the law of gravity that says that anything that goes up must come down. As a result, Mark Zuckerberg lost $6.9 billion on Tuesday.</p><p>Oracle has been in a trajectory of stock price growth since 28 January 2025, and Tuesday was not the exception, a day in which Larry Ellison increased his net worth by $6 billion.</p><p>Rob Walton is now the 12th richest person in the world, losing the 10th spot on Tuesday. Since 14 Feb 2025, Walmart’s stock has been falling, interrupting the impressive trajectory of growth that the company has been experiencing in 2025. The new 10th richest person is Steve Ballmer, who had lost that position on 14 Feb 2025, when Rob Walton took it from him. Now Ballmer is demonstrating that he is still in the race, even though it is a legitimate reason to feel concerned that Microsoft has been on a flat trajectory since 30 January 2025 (the day after the DeepSeek losses). Microsoft’s price was $414.99 on 30 January 2025, and went down to $409.64 on 18 February 2025. Microsoft is still the 3rd richest company in the world, but that crown will not last forever if Microsoft continues in a flat trajectory. Given the history of Microsoft, the expectation could be that the company is fighting for the crown of richest in the world again. But for now, simply growing and staying as number 3 in 2025 might be an ambitious enough goal for Microsoft.</p></div><div class=\"clearboth\">Published: 9:21 PM GMT · 19 Feb 2025</div><a href=\"https://jaimemontoya.com/opinion/\">Richest companies and people since 2024-Dec-21, including Jaime Montoya's stock market, business & finance opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT</a></p><div id=\"richest-company\"></div><div id=\"richest-people\"></div><div id=\"jaime-montoya-capital\"></div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ol><li><a href=\"about/\">About</a>: My one-page resume.<li><a href=\"blog/\">Blog</a>: Software technical documentation blog for myself and the world.<li><a href=\"book/\">Book reviews</a>: My reviews for some of the books I have read from cover to cover.<li><a href=\"capital/\">Capital</a>: Capital history in my records since May 5, 2024.<li><a href=\"coursera/\">Coursera</a>: Coursera courses I have successfully completed.<li><a href=\"finances/\">Finances</a>: Personal finance software I have created.<li><a href=\"investment\">Investment</a>: Mutual fund and stock investments I have made since April 12, 2024.<li><a href=\"news/\">News</a>: Personal news since November 7, 2024, 00:00 AM GMT.<li><a href=\"opinion/\">Opinion</a>: Stock Market, Business & Finance Opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT.<li><a href=\"portfolio/\">Portfolio</a>: Websites I have created, designed, developed, upgraded, maintained and/or hosted.<li><a href=\"reading/\">Reading</a>: Listing all of the books I have read from cover to cover since August 31, 2018.<li><a href=\"run/\">Running</a>: Running history I have endured since August 2, 2020.<li><a href=\"teaching/\">Teaching</a>: In-person classes I have taught.<li><a href=\"weight/\">Weight</a>: Weight history from my body since October 19, 2019.</ol></p>";
