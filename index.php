Meta received bad news: European Union regulations for WhatsApp. Saudi Aramco richer than Meta. Berkshire Hathaway richer than TSMC. Great Wednesday for Ellison. Ortega experienced losses as Inditex had a poor Wednesday.</a></h2><div class=\"floatleft\"><img src=\"/opinion/2025/02/20/01/11/img/20250220-0111-collage.jpg\" alt=\"20250220-0111-collage\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" class=\"floatleft\"><p>Since Wednesday, 12 Feb 2025, Tesla is experiencing growth again for its stock that has suffered an alarming pattern of price fall since around 21 Jan 2025. Finding stability is good news for Tesla. Elon Musk increased his net worth on Wednesday by $3.6 billion, a 0.92% increase.</p><p>For a second day in a row, Meta’s stock price is in decline. On Wednesday, the company’s price suffered a 1.76% loss. New regulations in the European Union could affect the WhatsApp messaging platform. News about tighter regulations is potentially a cause for financial losses for Meta in the future. This could include stricter content moderation and monitoring policies. Investors are probably concerned about those regulations. As a result, even when Saudi Aramco only experienced a modest growth of 0.18% on its stock price on Wednesday, that was enough to surpass Meta in market capitalization considering the bad Wednesday that Meta experienced. It was on 7 Feb 2025 that Meta became richer than Saudi Aramco, but now the positions are reversed. Saudi Aramco is the sixth richest company in the world, while Meta was downgraded 1 spot to number 7. That situation could be reversed very quickly, even this week. This is not difficult to interpret considering that Saudi Aramco is a defensive stock, as an oil producer. Meta is a technology, cyclical stock.</p><p>Berkshire Hathaway is now richer than TSMC. It was on 6 February 2025 that TSMC became richer than Berkshire Hathaway but the positions were reversed again to the original state. Now Berkshire Hathaway is the 10th richest company in the world, while TSMC was downgraded to number 11. This month, Trump has been saying that he would tariff foreign-made processors. He said, “Taiwan took our chip business away.” The uncertainty may be affecting TSMC as the political situation may represent the potential for the emergence of a new protectionist era.</p><p>Larry Ellison increased his net worth by $2.1 billion on Wednesday. His company, Oracle, is having a great 2025. Specifically from 28 Jan 2025, the stock price for Oracle has been in a pattern of growth. The company remains with a market capitalization value higher than $0.5 trillion.</p><p>Amancio Ortega lost $3.6 billion on Wednesday. Inditex suffered a stock price fall on Wednesday that interrupted the consistent pattern of growth that the company had experienced in the stock market from the 4th to the 18th of February 2025. Even after that significant $3.6 billion loss, Ortega remains as the 9th richest person in the world.</p></div><div class=\"clearboth\">Published: 1:11 AM GMT · 20 Feb 2025</div><a href=\"https://jaimemontoya.com/opinion/\">Richest companies and people since 2024-Dec-21, including Jaime Montoya's stock market, business & finance opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT</a></p><div id=\"richest-company\"></div><div id=\"richest-people\"></div><div id=\"jaime-montoya-capital\"></div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ol><li><a href=\"about/\">About</a>: My one-page resume.<li><a href=\"blog/\">Blog</a>: Software technical documentation blog for myself and the world.<li><a href=\"book/\">Book reviews</a>: My reviews for some of the books I have read from cover to cover.<li><a href=\"capital/\">Capital</a>: Capital history in my records since May 5, 2024.<li><a href=\"coursera/\">Coursera</a>: Coursera courses I have successfully completed.<li><a href=\"finances/\">Finances</a>: Personal finance software I have created.<li><a href=\"investment\">Investment</a>: Mutual fund and stock investments I have made since April 12, 2024.<li><a href=\"market/\">Market</a>: Monitoring tool to beat the market.<li><a href=\"news/\">News</a>: Personal news since November 7, 2024, 00:00 AM GMT.<li><a href=\"opinion/\">Opinion</a>: Stock Market, Business & Finance Opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT.<li><a href=\"portfolio/\">Portfolio</a>: Websites I have created, designed, developed, upgraded, maintained and/or hosted.<li><a href=\"reading/\">Reading</a>: Listing all of the books I have read from cover to cover since August 31, 2018.<li><a href=\"run/\">Running</a>: Running history I have endured since August 2, 2020.<li><a href=\"teaching/\">Teaching</a>: In-person classes I have taught.<li><a href=\"weight/\">Weight</a>: Weight history from my body since October 19, 2019.</ol></p>";
