Since 4 Feb 2025, Nvidia has been in a positive and consistent pattern of growth. Its stock price on 4 Feb was $118.65 and on 20 Feb it was $140.11. That is a growth of 18% in just 16 days. That is good news for Nvidia, but also sky high expectations. Investors may judge Nvidia severely if they hear any hint of trouble 26 Feb 2025, potentially making Nvidia’s stock to plunge again as it happened at the end of January 2025. For now, Nvidia is still looking strong and with positive results in February 2025.</p><p>Tesla had a negative Thursday in the stock market and the question has arisen: Can the company blame Elon Musk’s involvement in politics? That conversation is not specifically about the negative Thursday results, but in general about the poor performance of the company in 2025. 2 Jan 2025 started with a stock price of $379.28, and on 20 Feb, the price was $354.40. That is a negative 6.56% in 2025. Tesla is in negative numbers this year for its stock.</p><p>Larry Ellison is on a roller coaster of volatility for his net worth as a result of his company’s performance in the stock market. Oracle has again a market capitalization lower than $0.5 trillion after the bad results experienced by Oracle on Thursday. Overall, Oracle has increased its price by 6% in 2025. The results of Thursday should not be alarming yet, especially considering that Oracle had been a solid week of growth and positive results before the fall on Thursday. The balance is positive and Oracle is still bullish having a successful 2025.</p><p>Bernard Arnault increased his net worth by $2.8 billion on Thursday. His company LVMH has had generally flat stock results in February 2025, but since January 2025 was outstanding for the company, overall LVMH has a great 2025 balance.</p></div><div class=\"clearboth\">Published: 12:37 AM GMT · 21 Feb 2025</div>\n";
