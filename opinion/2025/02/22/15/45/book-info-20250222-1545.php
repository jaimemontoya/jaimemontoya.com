Also, being a defensive type of stock helped the company. If the economy received bad news that affected the global U.S. markets, Saudi Aramco was still in good shape. When the economy receives bad news, technology can become a less important priority. As a result, technology stocks may suffer more than water, gas, electric utilities, and in this case, oil production.</p><p>Berkshire Hathaway was upgraded from 10th to 9th richest company in the world. Broadcom was downgraded two spots from 9th to 11th. TSMC was upgraded from 11th to 10th. Broadcom’s stock price has been declining since 13 Feb 2025. From 28 Jan to 12 Feb 2025, Broadcom had been experiencing consistent stock price growth. But now the company is on the opposite trajectory.</p><p>The roller coaster for Oracle continues, with a stock price that goes up and down. Larry Ellison suffered another bad day in a row for his net worth. But it is difficult to evaluate the situation for Oracle based on the Friday results, since overall the U.S. stock market had negative results and that may have made investors sell their stock.</p><p>Bernard Arnault’s fortune had positive results, probably benefiting by being less exposed to the U.S. stock market bearish Friday.</p><p>Warren Buffett is now the 6th richest person in the world, being upgraded one spot. Larry Page moved from the 6th to the 7th position in the ranking. From 13 Jan 2025 to 19 Feb 2025, Berkshire Hathaway has been on a trajectory of growth, helping Buffett’s fortune. In the case of Alphabet, from 5 Feb to 21 Feb 2025, the company has been in an alarming trajectory of stock decrease that has made both Larry Page and Sergey Brin to have a fortune inferior to the one of Warren Buffett, when evaluating the individual net worth of each person.</p></div><div class=\"clearboth\">Published: 15:45 PM GMT · 22 Feb 2025</div>\n";
