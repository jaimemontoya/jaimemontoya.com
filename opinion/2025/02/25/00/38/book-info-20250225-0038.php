As a result, Berkshire Hathaway is richer than Tesla, where Berkshire Hathaway was upgraded one spot to the 8th position, and Tesla was downgraded to the 9th place in the ranking of richest companies in the world by market capitalization. Warren Buffett’s net worth grew by $5.9 billion on Monday. Buffett bragged about Berkshire’s Record Tax Payment: “Berkshire would not have achieved its results in any locale except America whereas America would have been every bit the success it has been if Berkshire had never existed. So thank you, Uncle Sam.”</p><p>Tesla has a -12.85% stock price performance in 2025. That is bad news for the company that became, on Monday, poorer than Berkshire Hathaway.</p><p>TSMC is now richer than Broadcom, with TSMC as the 10th richest company in the world, while Broadcom is number 11. Ironically, this happened in a day when both companies fell more than 3% in their stock price. But the fall for Broadcom was much higher (4.91%). TSMC just had a smaller stock price fall than Broadcom, and that was the only reason why it was upgraded one spot in the ranking of richest companies.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg decreased his net worth on Monday by $5.3 billion. Meta is in free fall mode now, a negative trajectory that started on 18 Feb 2025.</p></div><div class=\"clearboth\">Published: 12:38 PM GMT · 25 Feb 2025</div>\n";
