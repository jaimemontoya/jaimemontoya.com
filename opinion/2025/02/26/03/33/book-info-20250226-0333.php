Now the company is below the $1 trillion mark in market capitalization. Tesla was downgraded one spot from 9th to 10th richest company in the world, replaced by TSMC which moved up from 10th to 9th. TSMC had negative stock price results on Tuesday, but the catastrophic day of Tesla allowed TSMC to be upgraded one place. In the process, Elon Musk lost $15.6 billion on Tuesday.</p><p>Saudi Aramco had a positive stock price growth of 0.74% on Tuesday, better than all Magnificent 7 stocks (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla).</p><p>The positive net worth growth continued on Tuesday for Warren Buffett, who is in good shape to consolidate himself as the 6th richest person in the world, still richer than the Google founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin.</p><p>The weak performance of Meta in the stock market during the last few days, made it unsustainable for Mark Zuckerberg to remain as the second richest person in the world, and now he was downgraded one spot to 3rd place, with Jeff Bezos going back to 2nd place after being upgraded one spot on Tuesday.</p></div><div class=\"clearboth\">Published: 3:33 PM GMT Â· 26 Feb 2025</div>\n";
