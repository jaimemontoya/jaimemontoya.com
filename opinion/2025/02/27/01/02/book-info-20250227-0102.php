After the alarming decline that had started on 14 Feb 2025, for the first time Broadcom had great results of growth. The rebound may be related to Nvidia's earnings report, which resulted in positive guidance for the broader, general AI trends.</p><p>Apple interrupted on Wednesday its consistent stock price growth that had started on 11 Feb 2025. That caused Apple to have a negative 2025 balance, with a decrease of 1.43% this year.</p><p>The nightmare for Tesla continues and the question is, when will the company wake up? Some analysts believe Elon Musk’s involvement in politics is to blame. Protests have sprung up in U.S. cities, with some demonstrators explicitly asking to boycott Tesla. As a result, Tesla is not even in the top 10 of the ranking of richest companies in the world, with Tesla downgraded 1 spot from 10th to 11th. Broadcom took Tesla’s previous position, being upgraded from 11th to 10th.</p><p>Elon Musk lost $6.8 billion on Wednesday, Tuesday he had lost $15.6 billion, and Monday it was $4.1 billion that he lost in his net worth. It is true that Musk is still the richest man in the world, but the losses are massive, and significant to him. Simply adding up 6.8 + 15.6 + 4.1 = 26.5. That is $26.5 billion lost from Monday to Wednesday. For someone whose current net worth after the massive losses in 3 days, is $357.50 billion, it is fair to say that Musk is losing large amounts of money that cannot be ignored or be considered insignificant.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg finally had a positive day for his net worth. Meta had been in consistent and sharp stock decline since 18 Feb 2025. The situation finally changed on Wednesday and Meta experienced a good day of growth (2.46%). This resulted in Zuckerberg being upgraded from 3rd to 2nd place in the ranking of richest people on earth, with Jeff Bezos losing 1 spot moving from 2nd to 3rd. Yesterday Bezos became richer than Zuckerberg, but the situation was reversed in just one day. This should not be a surprise considering that Amazon has not been having a good 2025, when the company has had a stock price performance of -2.71%. Negative growth for Amazon after almost 2 months in 2025.</p></div><div class=\"clearboth\">Published: 1:02 PM GMT · 27 Feb 2025</div>\n";
