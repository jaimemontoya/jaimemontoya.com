The company is still the 6th richest in the world, but with the U.S. technology sector in a bullish environment, which has not been the case in 2025, it might be difficult for Saudi Aramco to stay in such a high position in the rankings.</p><p>Finally, Tesla had a positive day in the stock market on Friday. But that was not enough to make the February 2025 numbers become positive for the company. February was a catastrophic month for Tesla, where it started the month with a stock price of $383.68 on 3 Feb 2025, and on 28 Feb 2025 the price was $293.04. With the Friday positive results, Tesla moved from 11th to 9th richest company in the world. TSMC moved from 9th to 10th, while Broadcom was downgraded from 10th to 11th.</p><p>The extraordinary 2025 for Warren Buffett is at full speed. A growth of 13.91% in two months, January and February 2025, represents excellent results for the company. On Friday, Buffett’s net worth increased by $4.5 billion.</p><p>Bernard Arnault had a comparatively modest growth of $500 million on Friday, which was not as great as the growth for other top billionaire people in his league. The U.S. billionaires in the top 10 of the ranking probably all benefited from the positive day that the U.S. experienced in the stock market on Friday. Nonetheless, February 2025 had an overall negative balance for the U.S. stock market.</p></div><div class=\"clearboth\">Published: 7:27 PM GMT · 1 Mar 2025</div>\n";
