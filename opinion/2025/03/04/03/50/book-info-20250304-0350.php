Apparently those losses were the result of fears about the tariffs taking effect on 4 Mar 2025.</p><p>Nvidia stocks tumbled on Monday resulting from concerns regarding tariffs that could affect the company’s chip export sales. If AI spending is not sustainable for 2025, Nvidia would be likely to experience heavy financial losses. As a result of the terrible performance for Nvidia on Monday, Microsoft is now richer than Nvidia. It is not that Microsoft had a good Monday for its stock (2.14% decrease), but certainly Nvidia had a much worse day for its stock price (8.69%).</p><p>Bernard Arnault also benefited from not being in the U.S. for the headquarters of his company. His net worth decreased by $1 billion on Monday, but that is a smaller amount than what the other billionaires in his league of top 10 richest people in the world lost. For example, Jeff Bezos lost $6.6 billion on Monday. The week started with results that were a horrible nightmare for the U.S. stock market.</p></div><div class=\"clearboth\">Published: 3:50 PM GMT · 4 Mar 2025</div>\n";
