The company has experienced a 9.92% increase in its price in 2025. Tuesday was an interruption of the outstanding growth. The next three days of the week that the markets are operating, will define the trajectory of Berkshire Hathaway to start March. As a result of the poor performance for the company on Tuesday, Warren Buffett decreased his net worth by $4.6 billion (2.90% decrease) that day.</p><p>In the context of US President Donald Trump threatening to apply tariffs on overseas-made chips, TSMC announced plans to invest $100 billion in the United States.That may have helped the stock price for TSMC, which grew by 4.06% on Tuesday. TSMC and Broadcom are richer than Tesla, with Tesla being downgraded from the 9th to the 11th position in the ranking of richest companies in the world. TSMC was upgraded from 10th to 9th, while Broadcom was also upgraded, from 11th to 10th.</p><p>Larry Page had a good Tuesday to make his net worth grow by $3.1 billion (2.20% increase). That was a little relief considering that his company, Alphabet, has been experiencing consistent decrease in its stock price since 5 Feb 2025 to 3 Mar 2025.</p></div><div class=\"clearboth\">Published: 8:48 PM GMT Â· 5 Mar 2025</div>\n";
