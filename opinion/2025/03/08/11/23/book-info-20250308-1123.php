One great day was not expected to save the negative 2025 results for Broadcom stock price, which has fallen by 15.96% in 2025. As a result, Broadcam was upgraded from 11th to 10th richest company in the world, while Tesla fell one position, from 10th to 11th. The downhill for Tesla continues.</p><p>Saudi Aramco has been experiencing a significant stock price fall since 4 Mar 2025. The company is still one of the richest in the world, but its stock results in the last 365 days have been alarmingly negative: a 18.48% decrease.</p><p>Alphabet is finally starting to grow in 2025, with its March stock experiencing a positive trajectory after a catastrophic February. Amazon also experienced a disastrous February 2025, but its numbers in March are still in freefall trajectory. As a result, Alphabet is again richer than Amazon, with Alphabet upgraded from 5th to 4th in the ranking of richest companies in the world, while Amazon fell from 4th to 5th. Amazon had become richer than Alphabet on 4 Feb 2025, but now the results are reversed.</p><p>Friday was not a good day for Bernard Arnault’s net worth, when he lost $4.9 billion.

The negative stock trajectory for Oracle had started on 27 Feb 2025. The company finally interrupted, at least for one day on Friday, that negative stock price direction.</p></div><div class=\"clearboth\">Published: 11:23 AM GMT · 8 Mar 2025</div>\n";
