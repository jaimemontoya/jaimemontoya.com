Even in the uncertain times of political changes in the U.S., and the trade war fears, Berkshire Hathaway is increasing its wealth and navigating the crisis with successful results. Warren Buffett keeps increasing his wealth even during uncertain times.</p><p>Broadcom started the week with a 5.39% stock price decline, which is not surprising considering the terrible day in the U.S. stock market. As a technology company, fears about where the economy will go in 2025, can easily affect that sector.</p><p>Amazon is richer than Alphabet. Amazon was upgraded one stop from 5th to 4th, in the ranking of richest companies in the world, while Alphabet was downgraded from 4th to 5th. The competition to win, for now, is more about what company is losing less, rather than what company is winning money, in a difficult economic outlook under the new Trump administration.</p><p>Elon Musk continues experiencing alarming declines for his net worth. Every single week since President Trump's inauguration in January, Tesla has experienced a price share fall.</p><p>Jeff Bezos is again richer than Mark Zuckerberg, with Bezos being the 2nd richest person in the world now, and Zuckerberg, number 3. They switched positions today. There is nothing extraordinary that Bezos and Amazon did today to achieve that, other than losing less money than Meta and Zuckerberg, in another terrible day in 2025 for the U.S. stock market.</p></div><div class=\"clearboth\">Published: 12:00 AM GMT Â· 11 Mar 2025</div>\n";
