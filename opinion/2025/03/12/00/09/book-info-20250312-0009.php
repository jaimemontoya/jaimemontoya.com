This was probably the result of news that certain AI-driven Siri features would have a rollout delay. The plan is to launch those features in 2026. The expectation was for this to happen around April or the spring of 2025. Analysts believe this could hurt iPhone sales.</p><p>Broadcom had a great Tuesday for its share price, but Monday had been terrible. The company lost more on Monday than it won on Tuesday. This may suggest investors seeing value in stocks that are facing declines, but that have high value, such as Broadcom. That would align to the strategy of buy low, sell high.</p><p>Tuesday was finally a day of growth for Elon Musk’s net worth. Nonetheless, this could simply mean that investors are seeing the opportunity to buy low, predicting potential in Tesla for the artificial intelligence and robotics future that the company could revolutionize or at least, participate in the revolution. 2025 is still a nightmare for Elon Musk and Tesla.</p><p>Oracle reported its quarterly results, falling short of expectations. But the company has a strong outlook and ambitious future projects. The fortune of Larry Ellison was reduced by 2.52% on Tuesday.</p></div><div class=\"clearboth\">Published: 12:09 AM GMT · 11 Mar 2025</div>\n";
