The year to date performance for Apple is -11.72%. The year of 2025 has been difficult for the U.S. stock market overall, and Apple has not been a safe haven for investors.</p><p>Nvidia has been in a trajectory of growth for its share price since 11 Mar 2025. Nonetheless, the company experienced heavy declines from 21 Feb 2025 to 10 Mar 2025. One theory about the behavior of growth in the last couple of days for Nvidia’s stock price, is that sell-offs are seen by investors as buying opportunities, following the commonplace investment advice of buy low, sell high.</p><p>TSMC is now richer than Broadcom, with TSMC being upgraded from 10th to 9th place, and Broadcom the opposite, in the ranking of richest companies in the world. The price volatility continues for both companies.</p><p>Larry Ellison experienced a good Wednesday for his net worth with an increase of 4.44% relative to the previous day, which represents $7.9 billion. Oracle experienced a positive Wednesday for its share price, but overall, 2025 has been a negative year for the company with heavy losses of more than 10% in the price from the beginning of the year to now.</p><p>Amancio Ortega has been losing large sums of money as his company, Inditex, has been in stock price decline in a consistent way since 19 Feb 2025. The decline has been much more abrupt, and still consistent, since 11 Mar 2025. As a result, the company is in negative share price balance overall in 2025, with a decrease of approximately 10%. Ortega was downgraded from 9th to 10th richest person in the world, with Steve Ballmer moving from the 10th to the 9th position.</p></div><div class=\"clearboth\">Published: 1:56 PM GMT · 13 Mar 2025</div>\n";
