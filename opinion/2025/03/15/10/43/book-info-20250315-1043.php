The AI demand is helping Nvidia to maintain its position as the second richest company in the world, only behind Apple.</p><p>Saudi Aramco has a year to date decline of 7.49% for its share price. When evaluating the last 365 days, the decline is even worse: 16.69%. The company has accumulated so much money ($1.675 trillion in market capitalization) that even having a poor performance, it remains as the 6th richest in the world. In a healthier U.S. economy, that position could be difficult to keep.</p><p>From Monday to Friday, Meta was able to stabilize its situation and stop the consistent stock price fall. The week reached a flat trajectory, approximately, as compared to the freefall pattern that it had been experiencing during recent weeks. This is a relief for Mark Zuckerberg, who is still in a race as a solid contender to one day become the richest person on earth.</p><p>March 2025 has been difficult for LVMH. The company is in a freefall trajectory with its share price in consistent decline. Bernard Arnault, currently 76 years old, wants to keep running the company until he is 85. It remains to be seen how potential trade wars and political uncertainty will affect LVMH and Arnault’s fortunes.</p></div><div class=\"clearboth\">Published: 10:43 AM GMT · 15 Mar 2025</div>\n";
