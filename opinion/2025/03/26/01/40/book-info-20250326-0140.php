The year to date share price for the company has a -12.74% performance. From 14 Mar 2025 Nvidia has had a relatively flat price. But to return to positive territory, Nvidia needs to change its trajectory in a more consistent way. It is true that the company is highly volatile, but at the current pace, 2025 is not likely to perform better than the last couple of years.</p><p>Tesla is enjoying a sharp rebound. The question is again about sustainability. The uncertain political and economic environment in the United States contributes to a difficult to predict future for Tesla. For now, the company is experiencing an outstanding week and Tesla was upgraded from 11th to 10th richest company in the world, while Broadcom was downgraded from 10th to 11th. Both Tesla and Broadcom are highly volatile companies. The challenge for Tesla will be to remain in the top 10 consistently.</p><p>Larry Page had a great Tuesday increasing his fortune by $2.2 billion. Alphabet’s stock price has been growing since 19 Mar 2025. That has not been enough to change the reality of a negative 2025 for Alphabet, with a -9.36% year to date performance.</p><p>Amancio Ortega did not have a good Tuesday for his net worth. His company, Inditex, has experienced a flat stock price trajectory since 20 Mar 2025. With headquarters outside of the United States, Inditex is also suffering a difficult 2025 with a -7.73% year to date performance. The global markets may also be affecting the company, which is in a sector that probably would not benefit from the U.S. economic and political uncertainty.</p></div><div class=\"clearboth\">Published: 1:40 AM GMT · 26 Mar 2025</div>\n";
