The decline in recent days has been enough to allow Tesla to become richer than TSMC. Tesla is now the 9th richest company in the world, being upgraded one spot, while TSMC was downgraded from the 9th to the 10th place.</p><p>The net worth of Warren Buffett is growing steadily in 2025. His company, Berkshire Hathaway is the only one in the last 30 days with a positive stock price growth value from the list of top 10 richest companies. It is remarkable the success of this company in 2025, when many other companies are suffering the stock price declines that are affecting the U.S. stock market this year.</p><p>Larry Page saw his fortune decline by 1.66% on Thursday. The share price for Alphabet has suffered a decline of -1.86% in the last six months. The decline started on 5 Feb 2025. Two main reasons can be associated with this decline: 1) A weak Alphabet’s fourth-quarter earnings report, from the perspective of investors. 2) Concerns about the global economy.</p></div><div class=\"clearboth\">Published: 4:50 AM GMT · 28 Mar 2025</div>\n";
