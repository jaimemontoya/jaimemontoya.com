This was apparently good news for Tesla investors, and on Wednesday the company had a 5.33% share price increase. Tesla is richer than TSMC as a result of Tesla’s positive performance today. TSMC has suffered a year to date share price balance of -11.55%.</p><p>Meta is still in negative territory for its year to date share price performance. The decline started on 18 Feb 2025 and Meta, as many other companies in the technology sector, is trying to navigate the political and economic uncertainty of 2025 during the second term of President Donald Trump.</p><p>Larry Ellison is being mentioned as a possible bidder for the popular social media video platform, TikTok. Ellison’s proximity to Donald Trump might give him an advantage to be successful on this potential deal.</p><p>New “distractions” for Mark Zuckerberg are emerging as he needs to resolve a legal case that started in 2020 when the Federal Trade Commission sued Meta for supposedly suffocating competition by purchasing Instagram and WhatsApp instead of allowing them to become powerful independent businesses to grow as competitors for Meta and Facebook.</p><p>Steve Ballmer is richer than Amancio Ortega, swapping spots with Baller moving to 9th, and Ortega to 10th richest person in the world.</p></div><div class=\"clearboth\">Published: 8:41 AM GMT · 2 Apr 2025</div>\n";
