The company lost 9.25% of its value in one day. That is, ($3.363 - $3.052) trillion =  $0.311 trillion. The current stock price value of $203.19 for Apple is the worst since 11 Jun 2024. The numbers are revealing an alarming reality of poor performance for the U.S. stock market. Apple has not been immune to the negative trajectory in the U.S. markets.</p><p>Berkshire Hathaway is still demonstrating an impressive share price performance. The company is again scoring an all-time high value. The resilience of the company in difficult financial times is remarkable. Warren Buffett keeps making his net worth increase while many other top billionaires are losing large sums of money as a result of the stocks that have been plunging in the last couple of months.</p><p>The antitrust lawsuit against Meta by the Federal Trade Commission is still threatening Mark Zuckerberg’s fortune. The accusation claims that Facebook engages in illegal practices by buying Instagram and WhatsApp with the intention of choking competition. In other words, the accusations try to prove that the mergers were anti-competitive efforts to create a monopoly power for Facebook. Zuckerberg has apparently made several visits to President Donald Trump in recent months. It is speculated that Zuckerberg may be trying to persuade the U.S. President to settle the case against Facebook before the trial that is scheduled for 14 Apr 2025.</p><p>Amancio Ortega is richer than Steve Ballmer, with Ortega moving from 10th to 9th and Ballmer the opposite, in the ranking of richest people on the planet. The way the technology sector has been affected by the current U.S. stock market conditions has contributed to making Ballmer lose large sums of money this year.</p></div><div class=\"clearboth\">Published: 4:01 AM GMT · 4 Apr 2025</div>\n";
