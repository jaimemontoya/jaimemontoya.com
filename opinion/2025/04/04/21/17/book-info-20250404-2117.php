A sell-side analyst recently said that the participation of Elon Musk in politics has caused Tesla an “unprecedented brand damage”.</p><p>Saudi Aramco experienced a better stock price variation on Friday than many of the richest companies in the stock market, possibly benefiting from being in a sector that does not seem to be as vulnerable as what the technology sector is suffering in the stock market of the United States.</p><p>Even Warren Buffett, who had been navigating extraordinarily well the looming financial crisis, is not immune to the situation and he experienced a decrease of 6.5% to his fortune on Friday. At this pace all global markets and all sectors are likely to be affected in one way or another, if a global trade war further escalates.</p><p>Amancio Ortega lost less money than the rest of the top 10 billionaires in the world. It may have something to do with the headquarters of his company being outside of the United States, a country that is positioning itself in a difficult spot in a trade war that apparently has already started and it seems to be in a trajectory of alarming escalations as countries around the world respond to the tariffs established by President Donald Trump.</p></div><div class=\"clearboth\">Published: 9:17 PM GMT · 4 Apr 2025</div>\n";
