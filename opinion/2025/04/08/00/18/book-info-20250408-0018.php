The reason is the fact that Apple produces many of its products in a country heavily affected by the tariffs: China. The dependence on China for Apple to make its products is devastating in the current political environment of tariffs.

It is virtually impossible for Apple to move its manufacturing presence from China to the United States without significant, if not total disruption.</p><p>Volatility continues for Nvidia, and Monday was a good day for the company in the stock market.</p><p>In the current turbulent times in the markets, TSMC is again richer than Tesla, with TSMC enjoying an upgrade from 10th to 9th, and Tesla suffering a downgrade from 9th to 10th in the ranking of richest companies in the world.</p><p>Bernard Arnault is in a steady trajectory of decline for his fortune.
